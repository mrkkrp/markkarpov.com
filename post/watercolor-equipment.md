When I was starting out as a watercolor painter the first thing I did was
searching online for the best supplies: paint, paper, brushes, etc.
Ironically, by following the advice from the top search results I ended up
buying completely wrong things. This article contains recommendations that I
wish I had access to when I was in the beginning of my watercolor journey.

The choice of painting equipment and materials is always personal. Here, I
share *my* approach to painting. I'm not trying to give universal answers
that work for everyone. One's preferences are formed after trying and
comparing many different brands and types of supplies. This is a continuous,
and likely never-ending process. Because of that, this article is subject to
changes.

## Paper

Early frustrations with watercolor are often because of low-quality paper.
Indeed, paper is the single most important watercolor material as it has the
biggest influence on the final result. Watercolor paper determines how paint
flows and mixes and how long it remains wet on the surface. Good watercolor
paper is not cheap and typically will only be sold at shops that specialize
in high-quality art supplies.

### Material and sizing

I started with something like [Canson XL Watercolor
block][canson-xl-watercolor-block] simply because I wanted to start painting
as soon as possible and that's what was available in the shop nearby. I was
quite traumatized by the experience of using this paper. The paint did not
want to form smooth transitions and it would dry rather quickly. Any delay
with mixing colors would result in nasty and weird transitions. The paper is
merciless—not a place to start for a beginner, in my opinion. Don't get me
wrong, if I was to use this paper now, I'd probably make something decent
out of it just because I know how to work with watercolors. However, for a
beginner painting is already a battle of proving to yourself that you can
create something that doesn't “suck”, so adding to that fighting with your
supplies, namely paper, is not worth it.

Soon after my frustration with Canson I invested some time to learn what is
the best watercolor paper, this way I found [Arches][arches]. Arches is a
big name in the world of watercolor, and one thing you keep hearing about
Arches is that it is 100% cotton. This may lead to the belief that 100%
cotton paper is the best. In reality though, quality of paper is determined
by a number of other factors, such as sizing. Sizing, simply put, is a layer
of substance (usually gelatin) that is put on the surface of watercolor
paper to prevent paint from being immediately absorbed. The take away here
is that one should not reject non-cotton papers by default. Try different
papers and see how they feel. For example, after using Arches exclusively
for 6 months, I have recently switched to [Bockingford][bockingford]—0%
cotton paper. Bockingford is made of wood-free bleached chemical pulp. It is
a bit less forgiving, but it “eats” the color less than Arches, and gives a
fresher, more old-school watercolor look. I believe that Bockingford matches
my vision of what I want my paintings to look like.

### Texture and weight

Watercolor paper typically comes in three different textures:

* hot pressed (HP, *grain satiné* in French), which is absolutely smooth and
  lacks any texture.
* cold pressed (CP, or NOT, *grain fin* in French), which has some texture.
* rough (*grain torchon* in French), which has even more texture.

Here are some examples of the papers I usually use these days:

![Arches HP 140lb texture](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/arches-hp-140lb.jpg)
Arches HP 140lb texture

![Arches CP 140lb texture](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/arches-cp-140lb.jpg)
Arches CP 140lb texture

![Arches Rough 140lb texture](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/arches-rough-140lb.jpg)
Arches Rough 140lb texture

![Bockingford CP 200lb texture](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/bockingford-cp-200lb.jpg)
Bockingford CP 200lb texture (full sheet)

![Bockingford Rough 140lb texture](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/bockingford-rough-140lb.jpg)
Bockingford Rough 140 texture (pad)

I enjoy painting on all of these. Hot pressed paper is a bit special though,
because paint doesn't move much on the surface, so every brush stoke is
visible and will stay exactly where you put it. If more paint is used it
will tend to flow on the surface in a rather uncontrolled fashion:

![Paint flow on hot pressed paper](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/hot-pressed-paint-flow.jpg)

For these reasons, I reserve hot pressed paper for special moments when I am
in the mood to paint something less serious and to just fool around. Most of
the time though I use cold pressed or rough type of paper. I think that
there should be at least some texture so that the paint gets distributed on
the surface evenly and the “dry brush” technique can be used. With
Bockingford I feel like their cold pressed paper doesn't have enough
texture, so I tend to prefer rough. With Arches even normal cold pressed
paper has a lot of texture.

Another important characteristic of watercolor paper is its weight, or
thickness. Weight is usually expressed either in g/m2 or in pounds (lb).
Some common weights are:

* 185 g/m2 = 90 lb
* 300 g/m2 = 140 lb
* 425 g/m2 = 200 lb
* 640 g/m2 = 300 lb

I think watercolor paper should be at least 140 lb to prevent excessive
bulging. You might be tempted to use the heaviest paper available, but
remember that thickness will also influence the texture. For example, the
texture of Arches CP 300 lb will be more rough and pronounced than that of
Arches Rough 140 lb. I tend to use 140 lb and 200 lb papers.

### Size and formats

Watercolor paper comes in different formats:

* Spiral blocks (pads) and 1-side glued blocks (pads). Pads and blocks are
  the same thing, there is no unified terminology on this. I do not believe
  that you can fix the paper reliably enough on a spiral block or 1-side
  glued pad without separating it from the pad. What you likely need to do
  in these cases is take the sheet of paper from the block and then fix it
  on a drawing board with something like washi tape. This is extra work and
  it wastes the usable area of the paper (paper sold in this format is
  already relatively small) by adding a border to it.
* 4-side glued blocks (pads) do not suffer from this problem. Take the block
  and paint on it right away. No bulging will happen because the surface is
  reliably glued on 4 sides. You do not need to waste washi tape nor usable
  area of the paper. After you are done painting, take a [palette
  knife](#misc) and separate the paper from the block. I use pads for small
  paintings around 9"×12" or so.
* Rolls are problematic because you need to measure the paper to cut it in
  standard sizes and you need to straighten it afterwards, too.
* Sheets are a great way to buy watercolor paper. They usually come in
  standard size 22"×30" (56cm×76cm), called *imperial sheet*, and it is easy
  then to obtain half-sheets (15"×22") and quarter-sheets (11"×15") by
  folding the paper in two. Buying paper in sheets, especially in packs of
  25 full sheets, is very economical. This is also the only way I use to get
  paper for larger paintings. Good place to buy watercolor paper in sheets
  is [Jackson's art supplies][jacksons-art-supplies]. The shop provides a
  vide variety of different papers and it delivers them nicely packaged to
  your home. You can also ask to cut the paper and they do it for free.

In case you need to fix a piece of watercolor paper to a drawing board or
table, [mt washi tape][mt-washi-tape] is the best tool for this. It will
hold the paper reliably and will not come off in the middle of painting
process because it got a bit wet. However, in the end it can be easily
removed. Some papers are delicate though and you need to pull the tape
rather gently to avoid damaging the paper. I used to rely almost exclusively
on fixing paper with washi tape, but now I prefer 4-side glued pads. I
describe my approach to fixing paper for larger paintings in the section
about my [drawing board](#drawing-board-easel).

## Sketchbooks

Sometimes I paint in a sketchbook. It is rather hard to find one with
high-quality watercolor paper. I buy my sketchbooks from the [Koval
shop][koval-shop]. It is a little independent business run by a single
person who binds sketchbooks manually. The sketchbooks are rather expensive
though, for example one 6.9"×9.8" with Arches CP 140 lb paper costs about
86€. Availability can also be a problem as the sketchbooks are regularly
sold out.

## Brushes

First, here is some terminology:

* Capacity—how much mater/pigment a brush can hold. This depends on the
  material the bristles made of and the size of the belly of the brush.
* Snap—how quickly the bristles snap back after they are bent at an angle.
  Squirrel and goat have very little snap, while sable has more of it.
* Spring—how well the belly of the brush controls itself on the paper. Not
  every quality brush has snap, but they all should have spring.

Unless you are doing botanical watercolors, if you want a painterly, fresh
look, you want to use a fairly big brush, probably the biggest brush you can
control. There is no universal scale for brush sizes. Within a single lineup
by the same manufacturer a bigger number will correspond to a larger brush.
That's about as much information as you can get from the number on your
brush.

![Quill mops](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/quill-mops.jpg)

I favor large quill mops. These are all about 15 mm in diameter and about 40
mm in length. They all come to a nice point, so I can cover large areas and
paint little details with the same brush.

The round shape is the most versatile brush shape. You can't go wrong with
it. I used to use a large flat brush because it allowed me to fill large
areas easily. I also have a special brush (goat hair) just for applying
water. I do not use those often anymore as I rarely pre-wet big areas of
paper and my round mops are large enough to do the same job as my large flat
brush.

When it comes to the bristles, I prefer to have more snap for better
control. Therefore, if I were to opt for natural bristles, I'd need to buy
sable brushes, which are rather expensive. For that reason I prefer
synthetic brushes. They are less expensive and they do not encourage killing
of animals, such as the poor kolinsky sable. Of course, there is another
side to this natural vs synthetic debate: production of synthetic brushes
requires a lot of energy and petrochemicals and results in toxic byproducts
and waste. Synthetic brushes themselves do not decompose and have a shorter
lifespan which results in even more waste.

Mops in the picture above (from top to bottom):

* [Rosemary & Co. Red Dot Collection mop size 6][red-dot-quill-mop]. This is
  my favorite watercolor brush. Unlike most synthetic brushes that are
  branded as synthetic squirrel, this one is synthetic sable. Therefore it
  has more snap and gives me more control. This is the biggest mop of this
  series. I can also recommend size 5. However, I have also tried smaller
  sizes and they all split their point, making them almost unusable—probably
  it is a side-effect of having more snap? Make sure you are getting at
  least size 5.
* [Borciani Bonazzi Unico Infinito size 8][unico-infinito-mop]. This is my
  second best brush. I have only one complaint about it: its handle feels
  very cheap and plastic. I find this ironic, since they brand their handle
  as “not a simple plastic tube.” This is synthetic squirrel, hence it is
  much softer than the Red Dot Collection mop.
* [Princeton Neptune size 8][neptune-mop]. I expected more from this brush.
  It is synthetic squirrel and a very soft one at that. The brush has very
  little snap and its spring is not great. If you load it with paint and
  then try to paint with its whole belly only the middle part will leave
  marks on the paper. I plan on giving this brush away as I don't really use
  it much.
* [Winsor & Newton synthetic squirrel medium][winsor-newton-mop]. A very
  good brush. Overall, this is similar to Unico Infinito, but the bristles
  are a little bit less fun to work with. Unico Infinito's fiber is just
  superb.

Lately, synthetic brushes have improved considerably. All of these have
excellent capacities and can carry a lot of water, but not too much.

![Some smaller brushes](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/smaller-brushes.jpg)

Occasionally I want to paint smaller details where I don't want to “overdo”
it by accidentally holding my big brush too close to the paper. Then I use
one of these.

Smaller brushes in the picture above (from top to bottom):

* [Rosemary & Co. Red Dot Collection rigger size 4][red-dot-rigger].
* [Rosemary & Co. Red Dot Collection pointed round size 3][red-dot-round].
* A Chinese-style brush with raccoon hair. Unfortunately, I do not know the
  brand. I use it very rarely now that I have the Rosemary & Co. brushes.

Rosemary & Co. brushes are great and very reasonably priced. My favorite mop
cost me 19.90€. This is significantly cheaper than all other mops from the
list. Similarly, the riggers are very affordable—size 4 (on the picture)
cost me 4.20€.

Finally, for storing brushes nothing beats a simple bamboo roll:

![Bamboo roll](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/bamboo-roll.jpg)

Keep it open for a while to let the air dry your brushes after you rinsed
them after painting.

## Paint

![Various tube paints](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/tube-paints.jpg)

I use tube paint. Only tube paint allows me to achieve the full range of
paint consistency. Pans do not allow us to quickly mix intense-enough,
toothpaste-like paint. You have to rub and rub with your brush to pick up
enough paint. This wears out the brush and is just slow and annoying. I made
the mistake of buying pans at first and then I regretted it bitterly.

My opinion is that one has to use a limited palette. 12 or 16 colors maximum
is all you need. In the beginning though, I would start with even fewer
colors and concentrate on understanding how they mix.

The most economical way of buying paint is to go to a specialized shop and
pick the tubes you want individually. For this, you need to have an opinion
about what colors you need. If you buy a set you will soon discover that it
doesn't have the colors *you* want and you will have to buy more. Some of
the colors that came with the set will be abandoned.

Tube paint needs to stay in a paste-like state. This is important. If it
dries it becomes just like pan paint and thus loses all its advantages. To
keep tube paint in usable condition spray it with a [water spray](#misc)
generously every day, but avoid excessive puddles. Obviously, store your
palette closed to limit access of fresh air that can dry your paint.

With regard to brands, I have used tube paint from 2 brands for a while
(both artist quality paint, don't bother with student-grade):

* [Sennelier][sennelier-paint]. This was the first tube paint I used. It is
  great paint, but I found that it is not intense enough. Honey-based paint
  is also, in my opinion, worse than gum arabic-based one such as Daniel
  Smith and Winsor and Newton. It tends to re-wet worse and after a while it
  dries weirdly and cracks. I don't know what happens there, maybe the honey
  gradually gets washed out or something.
* [Daniel Smith][daniel-smith-paint]. Intense and superb. Re-wets
  beautifully, stays moist for a long time. With some spraying you can
  always keep tube paint in usable condition. In my opinion, this is the
  best paint on the market. Some people complain about its high price, but
  remember that you get 15mm tubes, not 10mm tubes like with most other
  brands.

I'm not going to talk about how to put together a palette here because this
deserves a post of its own.

## Palette

My current palette is (I believe) [Holbein 1130-40][holbein-1130-40], it
looks like this:

![Holbein 1130-40](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/palette-closed.jpg)

And here is how it looks inside:

![Holbein 1130-40 (opened)](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/palette-opened.jpg)

It is possible that this is not a genuine Holbein palette. I bought it here
in Paris from [Magasin Sennelier][magasin-sennelier], which is a respectable
shop with a long history, but you can never be sure, as there are many fake
palettes that purport to look like Holbein.

I am, however, not satisfied with this palette because it doesn't have
enough paint wells (only 13) and only 3 usable mixing wells, 2 of which are
insufficiently separated from each other. When I paint standing and use
rather diluted washes, e.g. for painting a sky, the paint flows all around
and it's a big mess.

I chose this palette because others with more paint wells had some of the
wells on the lid of the palette. Since I keep my palette closed when I'm not
painting to prevent the paint from drying, paint wells on the lid would be
problematic. I don't know who came up with this nonsensical idea of putting
them there.

A palette to crave is a hand-made brass one. There are a number of one-man
companies that manufacture these palettes. I have to say, they are all
rather expensive and there is always a long (about 1 year) waiting list.

Here are some companies that make brass palettes:

* [The Little Brass Box Company][little-brass-box-company]
* [The Watercolor Paint Box Company][watercolor-paint-box-company]
* [Brass Palette India][brass-palette-india] (warning: this is a Facebook
  page, as Brass palette India has no proper website)

In my opinion The Little Brass Box Company makes the best palettes. I'm
currently in the waiting list to get a Binning Monro style palette in summer
2022:

![Binning Monro style palette](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/binning-monro-palette.jpg)

## Pencils and erasers

![Lead holder KOH-I-NOOR Versatil 5640 and kneadable art eraser Faber-Castell 10003496](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/lead-holder-and-kneadable-eraser.jpg)

Oftentimes, you will need to do some drawing before you start painting. This
is usually done with a pencil. I recently switched to using a mechanical
pencil, or a “lead holder”, instead of normal pencils. The benefits of a
lead holder are the following:

* No wood wasted.
* The tool always stays the same and feels the same in hand.
* It is heavy and solid and inspires free and painterly movements.
* You can use fairly thick graphite, e.g. 5.6 mm, which feels softer and
  lasts longer.

On the picture you can see [KOH-I-NOOR Versatil 5640][versatil-5640].

If I had to use a pencil, I would use 3B or softer.

Also, it is useful to have a way to erase certain lines. The problem with
normal erasers is that they can easily damage the paper and then it will
show in the final painting. This is not a problem with kneadable art
erasers. They have great plasticity and are sort of sticky. You can tap them
on the paper gently and they will lift graphite without damaging the paper.
My favorite is shown on the photo above, it is [Faber-Castel kneadable art
eraser][faber-castell-art-eraser].

## Drawing board / easel

![My drawing board](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/drawing-board.jpg)

I paint standing. I feel like when I paint sitting I'm more stiff and less
free. Another consideration is whether you want to keep paper flat or at an
angle. In the beginning, I started flat by attaching paper to my desk with
washi tape, but once I tried to paint at a 30-45° angle there was no going
back. The paint doesn't tend to form puddles in random places and flows down
which is something you can leverage when e.g. painting sky. Typically, there
are little drops of paint forming but they are obvious and easy to deal
with, whereas on the rest of the surface paint gets applied in an optimal
way.

Because of all that, I need a drawing board that can be fixed at different
angles and different heights. Unfortunately, there is no good solution on
the market that I can recommend. It is my understanding that everyone who is
serious about watercolors builds something themselves. Fortunately, it is
not hard to do.

In my case, because I love doing [photography][photography], I already had a
very good tripod. So, the easiest solution for me was to buy a compatible
quick release and glue it to a piece of thick carton or MDF with epoxy glue:

![Quick release glued with epoxy glue](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/drawing-board-quick-release.jpg)

It then can be attached to my tripod:

![Drawing board is attached to a camera tripod](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/drawing-board-attached.jpg)

I still fix paper on this board with washi tape unless I work with a block
of paper glued on 4 sides.

Now, however, I want to stop using washi tape completely and at the same
time start painting larger paintings. For that I'm building 2 new drawing
boards. The base is similar in that it is thick carton or MDF with a quick
release glued onto it. However, I chose to make the new boards with sizes
matching full imperial and half-imperial sheets. I also bought pieces of
organic glass in which I'm going to cut windows; then I'm going to attach
them onto these carton boards. Paper will then be sandwiched between the
carton and the glass. I discovered this idea when I was watching [this
video][andrew-pitt-setup] by Andrew Pitt.

I decided to take advantage of the fact that there's going to be a rather
significant border (Andew Pitt calls it “deckle edge”) around paintings with
this setup to change the aspect ratio to make it more appropriate for
painting landscapes.

* My larger drawing board is going to be for working on full imperial sheets
  with the window for actual painting 15"×24".
* A smaller one is going to be for working on half-imperial sheets with the
  window for actual painting 11"×17".

Regarding stretching paper, I do not find it necessary neither with washi
tape nor with pads glued on 4 sides. Andrew Pitt says that it is not
necessary with his setup either.

## Misc

Some indispensable items that are hard to put in a separate category:

![Brush holder, a piece of tissue, pieces of a sponge, and a water spray](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/misc.jpg)

* Brush holder. You need some kind of brush holder.
* Water spray. As mentioned in [the section about paint](#paint) it is
  absolutely necessary to keep your tube paint moist. This little spray is
  my way of doing that. It is also occasionally useful for spraying water
  onto paper for artistic effects.
* A piece of tissue is the best way to control the amount of water/paint in
  your brush. This is crucial. I never paint without a piece of tissue.
* Pieces of a sponge that I use for cleaning my palette.

Also useful, but not required:

![Palette knife](/static/img/watercolor-equipment/palette-knife.jpg)

A palette knife. My instrument of predilection for lifting paint by
scratching and for separating sheets of paper from a pad.
