Hey there! As some of you know I've been active in open source for some time
but lately there are quite a few things outside of coding that need my
attention. I still write Haskell outside of work, but my activity is
incomparable to what it was before. In addition to that, even when I have
free time I'm more inclined to digging Coq or something like that nowadays,
not Haskell per se.

To ensure that projects that are useful for others remain in good state and
in case I'm hit by bus, I'm asking interested (and qualified, preferably)
people to become co-maintainers of some of my projects.

All currently active and supported projects are listed in the OSS section on
my site:

<https://markkarpov.com/oss.html>

I think the most interesting sub-sections are “Haskell” and “MMark” but I'm
keen to add co-maintainers for the other projects as well if people are
interested.

Thanks!
