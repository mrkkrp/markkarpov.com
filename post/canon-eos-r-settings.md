Recently I bought Canon EOS R. It is Canon's first full-frame mirrorless
camera, relatively inexpensive, and most importantly it gives you access to
the new wonderful RF glass.

In this post I will explain the tweaks I made to the default configuration.
I'm not going to explain each and every thing you can change, there are
already posts like that and the official manual. Instead I'll focus on how
to make the camera easier and quicker to operate—so that you won't miss a
good shot. If I don't mention a setting it means that the default is OK.

Press the `Menu` button to access the settings.

## Still photo shooting

This is the red menu with little camera icon.

* `Image quality` (page 1). I set it to RAW. RAW files contain raw data from
  the sensor. It allows you to get better results during [post-production
  phase][workflow] than with JPEG which is a lossy, compressed image format.
  JPEG files can be obtained from RAW files during development of digital
  negatives which is something you probably will be doing anyway if you've
  bought this sort of camera. I see no point in duplicating information by
  shooting in both RAW and JPEG. There is no added safety either because
  both types of files are stored on the same card.

* `Image review` (page 1). I turn it off. Why? With mirrorless camera you
  get pretty good idea of what you're going to get when you press the
  shooting button. Reviewing your shots is a waste of time which may be very
  valuable in certain situations. Instead, just shoot and concentrate on
  what you're doing in real time. When it's over you can check the results.
  Bad shots will be bad, good shots will be good, regardless of the time
  when you check them, but you'll have more material to choose from! It's OK
  to have review enabled if you're shooting something that is not moving and
  where you can't really miss a moment.

* `ISO speed settings` (page 3). In the `ISO speed range` sub-menu, it's a
  good idea to decrease the lower limit for ISO to 50 (marked as L) instead
  of the default 100. Many people do not know that it is possible to unlock
  lower ISO or their cameras. Sometimes it is handy to be able to use 50
  when there is too much light.

## Auto-focus

This is the purple menu with the two letters AF. There are a few settings
here that you will want to tweak depending on situation but you can do it by
pressing `M-Fn` button or `Q set` button, so I'll skip them here.

* `Touch & drag AF settings` (page 1). Enable touch & drag AF. It's hard to
  imagine not being able to move the AF area while looking through the view
  finder, but it's disabled by default! Positioning method should be
  relative, active touch area should be right. This way you can move the AF
  area using your right thumb while looking through the view finder.

## Set-up

This is the yellow menu with wrench icon.

* `Beep` (page 3). A matter of taste, but I disable it because it is obvious
  to me when the camera focuses. I don't like to go around beeping all the
  time and distracting people (who I may want to shoot!).

## Custom functions

This is the orange menu with camera icon with some sort of meter underneath.

* `Customize buttons` (page 4). There is a mismatch between position of
  buttons and their function. Some pretty handy buttons are hard to press
  without looking.

  * The `AF-ON` button does exactly the same thing as half-pressed shooting
    button, and yet it occupies a very ergonomic spot. I use it to set AF
    point to center, because I often move AF point temporarily and always
    want to restore it later when I'm done with the scene.

  * `AE lock button` is close to `AF-ON` and also is pretty easy to reach
    without looking. I use it for depth of field preview. By default you see
    the depth of field with wide open aperture—it does not adjust in real
    time as you change your aperture value to let the camera auto-focus
    better in low light and have better image in the view finder. Depth of
    field preview is a useful function which is not assigned to any button
    by default.

  * `AF point button` is also in the same region. I use it to switch between
    one-shoot AF and servo AF.

* `Customize dials` (page 4). The two standard dials are OK, except the
  so-called `Quick control dial` (closer to you) is harder to rotate and by
  default it controls aperture which is the setting that [I tweak most
  often][exposure]. This is why I set the control ring on the lens to
  control aperture as well. You could think that duplicating functions like
  this is wasteful, but things you do often should be very easy and quick
  (the lens' ring being the easiest thing to rotate IMO). Also, there is
  very limited choice with regard to `Quick control dial` alternative
  functions so I just keep it as is.

* `Customize M-Fn bar` (page 4). `M-Fn` bar is useful, but it doesn't do
  anything by default. I set it to control ISO. Truth to be told, I almost
  [always use `Auto-ISO`][exposure] anyway because adjusting it manually is
  a waste of time and you'll be missing shots. Modern cameras can figure out
  ISO pretty well these days, so you need to think about fewer things when
  shooting. I disable the safety lock, because unlocking it takes time. If
  you accidentally touch it once and tweak ISO, it's not the end of the
  world, you can bring it back.

## Conclusion

There are many more settings to tweak in certain situations, but these I
find essential for quick operation at all times. Happy shooting!
