## Summary

I'm a software engineer specializing in functional programming using strong
static type systems. I have worked many years as a full-time consultant
helping our clients design and build correct, robust, and maintainable
software. Being a consultant allowed me to participate in more projects that
a typical software engineer gets to work on. I've developed the ability for
critical thinking, making wise trade-offs, analyzing and exploiting
advantages of various technologies to satisfy needs of business. I also
learned how to handle different personalities and collaborate with diverse
teams. My personal projects include high-profile Haskell libraries,
tutorials, and a technical blog.

## Professional experience

* **January 14, 2019–present.** Senior software engineer at
  [Tweag](https://tweag.io), Paris, France. Working as a consultant most
  part of the time, but also building OSS, writing blog posts, doing
  interviews for new hires, etc.
* **January 25, 2018–January 11, 2019.** Software engineer at
  [Tweag](https://tweag.io) (remote). Worked as a consultant with a number
  of clients, helped developing Bazel rules for Haskell.
* **May 4, 2016–May 20, 2017.** Tier 2 Haskell developer at [Stack
  Builders](https://www.stackbuilders.com/) (remote). Consulting several
  clients mostly from the US. Agile. Another part of the job was writing
  tutorials and blog posts to increase visibility of the company.

## Open source

  [“Why Haskell is
  important”](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-09-06-why-haskell-is-important.html).

  websockets).
* Other languages I know: C, C++, Python, Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp.

## Soft skills

* I know how to work with people who have different types of personalities
