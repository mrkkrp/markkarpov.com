\section*{Summary}

Software engineer specializing in functional programming using strong static
type systems, in Haskell in particular.

I strive to build systems that are simple, maintainable, easy to understand,
and future-proof. Experience has taught me that the work is about exploiting
strong sides of Haskell to achieve balance between simplicity and safety. It
is also about happiness of developers and efficient conversion of money into
value, rather than type-level acrobatics or proving how clever we can be.

\section*{Tech work experience}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{May 4, 2016--May 20, 2017} Tier 2 Haskell developer at
  \href{https://www.stackbuilders.com/}{Stack Builders} (remote). The job
  involved working for several clients mostly from the US. Web-applications
  built with Yesod, Snap, Servant (including a micro-service based system
  with Servant on backend). Agile. Another part of the job was writing
  tutorials and blog posts to increase visibility of the company.
\item \textbf{January 25, 2018--January 11, 2019} Software engineer at
  \href{https://tweag.io}{Tweag} (remote). Worked as a consultant with a
  number of clients, helped developing Bazel rules for Haskell.
\item \textbf{January 14, 2019--present} Senior software engineer at
  \href{https://tweag.io}{Tweag}, Paris, France.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Haskell}

I've worked using Haskell on daily basis for 5 years. I used it to build
open source projects and to help a number of clients build their products.
In both cases I got continuous positive feedback throughout my career.

\section*{Nix}

I started using Nix in 2018 when I joined Tweag. I use Nix and NixOS on
daily basis and continue improving my Nix skills.
