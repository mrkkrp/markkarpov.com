## Summary

Software engineer specializing on functional programming using strong static
typing, in Haskell in particular.

## Tech work experience

* **May 4, 2016–May 20, 2017** Tier 2 Haskell developer at [Stack
  Builders](https://www.stackbuilders.com/) (remote). The job involved
  working for several clients mostly from the US. Web-applications built
  with Yesod, Snap, Servant (including a micro-service based system with
  Servant on backend). Agile. Another part of the job was writing tutorials
  and blog posts to increase visibility of the company.

* **January 25, 2018–present** Software engineer at [Tweag
  I/O](https://tweag.io) (remote).

## Haskell

* Concepts (not mentioning basic things like rank-N types, existentials,
  phantom types etc.): EDSL using combinators, GADTs, type-level
  programming, generics, TH, high-performance Haskell, parallel and
  concurrent Haskell, FFI, lens (van Laarhoven/profunctor).

* Libraries I'm familiar with (not mentioning vital common things like
  `monad-control` and `base`): `lens`, `aeson`, `conduit`,
  `postgresql-simple`, `persistent`, `esqueleto`, `dbmigrations`, `parsec`,
  `megaparsec`, `attoparsec`, `yesod`, `snap`, `servant`, `http-client`,
  `http-conduit`, `wreq`, `req`, `cryptonite`, `warp`, `websockets`,
  `socket`, `network`, `HUnit`, `hspec`, `QuickCheck`, `test-framework`,
  `tasty`, `hedgehog`, `webdriver`, `optparse-applicative`, `path`,
  `path-io`, `stache`, `vector`, `containers`, `unordered-containers`,
  `binary`, `cereal`, `store`, `distributed-process`, `reflection`,
  `constraints`, `kan-extensions`, etc. I have experience with most of the
  libraries in active use in the Haskell ecosystem.

## Technologies

* Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL.
* AWS.
* Linux server.
* Strong knowledge of Git.
* CI: Travis CI, Circle CI.
* Dependent types, theorem provers: Coq.
* Bash/Python/Haskell scripting.
* Build systems: make, shake, Bazel.
* Server automation: Ansible.
* Front-end: HTML (5), CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript (jQuery, AJAX,
  websockets).
* Other languages I know: C, C++, Python, Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp.

## Open source

* [Megaparsec](https://github.com/mrkkrp/megaparsec)—Industrial-strength
  monadic parser combinator library.
* [Req](https://github.com/mrkkrp/req)—Easy-to-use, type-safe, expandable,
  high-level HTTP library.
* [Zip](https://github.com/mrkkrp/zip)—Efficient library for manipulating
  zip archives.
* [MMark](https://github.com/mmark-md/mmark)—Strict markdown processor for
  writers.

## Writing

* I've authored a number of tutorials as part of my job and on my own, see
  e.g. [GHC optimization and
  fusion](https://www.stackbuilders.com/tutorials/haskell/ghc-optimization-and-fusion/),
  the full list is available at <https://markkarpov.com/learn-haskell.html>.

* Blog posts are available [here](https://markkarpov.com/posts.html), see
  e.g. [Free monad considered
  harmful](https://markkarpov.com/post/free-monad-considered-harmful.html)
  from the recent ones.

* I've authored two chapters for the upcoming book [Intermediate
  Haskell](https://intermediatehaskell.com/): Exceptions and Megaparsec.
  Unfortunately the content is not publicly available yet (only available to
  reviewers).

## Soft skills

* I speak Russian (native) and English (fluent, experienced with
  documentation/tutorial writing).

* Stress-resistant, open to criticism/discussion.

## Education

* 2009–2014—Polzunov Altai State Technical University. Engineer degree in
  informational technology and measuring engineering.
