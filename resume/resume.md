## Summary

I am a software engineer who applies the principles of functional
programming to solve real-world problems. I have been working as a
consultant in the domain of reproducible build systems, functional
programming, and Nix for more than 7 years.

## Professional experience

* 2025–present. **Senior principal scalable builds engineer at [Modus
  Create][modus].** As a consultant, I spend most of my time helping our
  clients to achieve their goals through use of [Bazel][bazel]. This
  includes ensuring hermeticity and reproducibility of builds, optimization
  of build speed and CI times, dependency management, integration between
  various tools and the build system. Many of our clients are large
  companies, in particular in the automotive industry and robotics. I am
  also a manager with around 8 reports.
* 2023–2025. **Principal consultant at [Modus Create][modus].**
* 2019–2023. **Senior software engineer at Tweag** in Paris, France.
* 2018–2019. **Software engineer at Tweag** (remote).
* 2016–2017. **Tier 2 Haskell developer at [Stack Builders][stackbuilders]**
  (remote). Primarily development in Haskell for a number of clients.

## Open source

I have been active in open source for the last 8 years. My most significant
open source contributions have been in the [Haskell][haskell] ecosystem:

* [Ormolu][ormolu]—The de-facto standard formatter for Haskell source code.
* [Megaparsec][megaparsec]—Industrial-strength monadic parser combinator
  library.
* [Req][req]—An HTTP client library.

The full list can be found at <https://markkarpov.com/oss.html>.

## Writing

For the last 8 years I did a lot of technical writing both in my own time
and for Tweag/Modus Create. Over a period of time I was a blog editor for
<https://www.tweag.io/blog>.

* My blog posts are available at <https://markkarpov.com/posts.html>, see
  e.g. [“How to keep a Bazel project hermetic”][hermetic-bazel].
* I have authored a number of tutorials as part of my job and on my own, see
  <https://markkarpov.com/learn-haskell.html>.

## Technologies

* Build systems, Bazel in particular.
* [Nix][nix].
* Haskell.
* Strong knowledge of Git.
* DevOps experience.
* AWS and GCP.
* Docker.
* CI: GitHub actions, Travis CI, Circle CI, Buildkite.
* Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL.
* Linux server.
* Other languages I know (some may be rusty): OCaml, Rust, C, C++, Common
  Lisp, Emacs Lisp, Python.

## Soft skills

* The experience of leading teams and supporting colleagues.
* The ability to work with people with diverse personalities and skill
  levels.
* Good communicator; many years of experience as a consultant in a diverse
  range of companies.
* I speak Russian (native), English (fluent), and French (fluent).

## Education

* 2009–2014—Polzunov Altai State Technical University. Engineer degree in
  informational technology and measuring engineering.
