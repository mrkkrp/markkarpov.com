Hey there! I'm a software engineer based in Paris, France. I work at
[Tweag][tweag].

I come from a little town called [Biysk][biysk] in Russia, in the middle of
~~nowhere~~ Siberia. I learned about functional programming on my own while
struggling with poverty and working hard to provide for myself. Soon, my
enthusiasm paid offâ€”I was able to start my career as a software engineer
doing Haskell. Along the way, I authored a number of [open source
projects][oss], [blog posts][posts], and [tutorials][tutorials]. In the
beginning of 2018 I joined Tweag, which I regard as one of the most
auspicious decisions in my life. Soon I moved to France.

Haskell is nice, yet software engineering is bigger than Haskell. I went on
to learn a number of different technologies and soft skills. I learned
French and improved my English. I navigated an unfamiliar country while
learning how to lead teams.

Yet life is bigger than software engineering. I enjoy travelling and I am an
avid reader in all three languages that I speak. My hobbies include writing
(mostly literary short stories in English), music,
[photography](/galleries.html), and watercolor painting. I'm working on
adding some of my creative output to this site, stay tuned!
