## Summary

Haskell software developer with 3 years of experience, including 1 year of
professional experience.

## Tech work experience

* **May 4th, 2016–May 20th, 2017** Tier 2 Haskell developer at [Stack
  Builders](https://www.stackbuilders.com/) (remote). The job involved
  working for several clients mostly from the US. Web-applications built
  with Yesod, Snap, Servant (including a micro-service based system with
  Servant on backend). A part of the job was also writing tutorials and blog
  posts to improve visibility of the company.

## Technologies

* Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL.
* Ansible.
* Linux server.
* Strong knowledge of Git.
* CI: Travis CI, Circle CI.
* Front-end (mostly vanilla web): HTML (5), CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
  (jQuery, AJAX).
* Bash/Python/Haskell scripting.
* Other languages I know: C, C++, Python, Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp.

## Haskell

* Concepts (not mentioning basic things like rank-N types, existentials,
  phantom types etc.): EDSL using combinators, GADTs, type-level
  programming, generics, TH, high-performance Haskell, parallel and
  concurrent Haskell, lens (van Laarhoven/profunctor).

* Libraries (not mentioning vital common libs like `monad-control` and
  `base`): `lens`, `aeson`, `conduit`, `postgresql-simple`, `persistent`,
  `esqueletto`, `dbmigrations`, `parsec`, `megaparsec`, `attoparsec`,
  `yesod`, `snap`, `servant`, `http-client`, `http-conduit`, `wreq`, `req`,
  `cryptonite`, `warp`, `hunit`, `hspec`, `QuickCheck`, `test-framework`,
  `tasty`, `hedgehog`, `webdriver`, `optparse-applicative`, `path`,
  `path-io`, `stache`, `vector`, `containers`, `unordered-containers`,
  `binary`, `cereal`, `store`, etc. I've probably worked with everything
  that has more or less decent visibility/use in the community.

## Writing

* I've authored a number of tutorials as part of my job and on my own, see
  e.g. [GHC optimization and
  fusion](https://www.stackbuilders.com/tutorials/haskell/ghc-optimization-and-fusion/),
  the full list is available at https://markkarpov.com/learn-haskell.html.

* Blog posts are available [here](https://markkarpov.com/posts.html), see
  e.g. [Megaparsec: more speed, more
  power](http://localhost:5000/post/megaparsec-more-speed-more-power.html)
  from the recent ones.

* I've authored two chapters for the upcoming book [Intermediate
  Haskell](https://intermediatehaskell.com/): Exceptions and Megaparsec.
  Unfortunately the content is not available yet (except for reviewers).

## Soft skills

* I speak Russian (native) and English (fluent, experienced with
  documentation/tutorial writing).

* Stress-resistant, open to criticism/discussion.

## Education

* 2009–2014—Polzunov Altai State Technical University. Engineer degree in
  informational technology and measuring engineering.
