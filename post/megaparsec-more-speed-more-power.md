title: "A major upgrade to Megaparsec: more speed, more power"
desc: The post describes extension of the Stream type class that allowed to make the Megaparsec library more efficient and simplify code base.

It looks like comparing Haskell's performance with C (even just FFI) causes
too much disturbance in the force, so this time I'll be comparing Haskell
with Haskell, namely Megaparsec 6 (still in making) with the gold standard
of fast parsing in the Haskell world—Attoparsec.

The post is about a modification to Megaparsec extending its `Stream` type
class to achieve four goals:

1. Allow to return more natural types from things like `string`. If you
   parse `Text` stream, you should get `Text` from there, with minimal
   repacking/overhead. (Megaparsec 5 returns `String ~ [Char]` for any
   stream of tokens `Char`.)

2. Reduce allocations and increase speed. Consuming input token by token and
   repacking them into `String` for example is not most efficient way to
   parse a row of tokens. Surely we can do better.

3. Add more combinators like `takeWhile`, which should return “chunks” of
   input stream with correct type (e.g. `ByteString` if we parse
   `ByteString` stream). This is to match what Attoparsec can do.

4. Make code simpler by moving the complex position-updating logic that we
   keep for custom streams of tokens into the methods of the `Stream` type
   class. This way if you have a custom stream of tokens, you'll have to
   write the correct position updating code. At the same time, default
   streams (`String`, `Text`, `ByteString`) will enjoy simplified, faster
   processing.

## Benchmarks

We're going to need some benchmarks. I have made the repo with the code I
used for comparison public, it can be found here:
<https://github.com/mrkkrp/parsers-bench>.

It contains 3 pairs of parsers:

* CSV parser (original code)
* JSON parser (stolen from Attoparsec's `Aeson.hs` benchmark with simplifications)
* Log parser (stolen from School of Haskell [tutorial](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/starting-with-haskell/libraries-and-frameworks/text-manipulation/attoparsec))

I do not want to focus on microbenchmarks, instead I want to compare “common
place”, average parsing code people usually write with the libraries
(fortunately the code written using Attoparsec is easily convertable to
Megaparsec). To make the comparison fair, I also do not use complex monadic
stacks with Megaparsec, as it would surely make it slower (with Attoparsec
you just can't do that after all).

Running the benchmark with Megaparsec before any `Stream`-related
optimizations gives us the starting point:

![Megaparsec vs Attoparsec (before optimizations)](/static/img/megaatto-beginning.png)

Honestly, this is better than I expected. Average Megaparsec parser is just
twice as slow as average Attoparsec parser. Now what is really interesting
is how close we can get to performance of the venerable library without
compromising on flexibility and quality of error messages.

## Extending `Stream` and adding new primitives

In this section I'm going to explain how the `Stream` type class has been
extended (or rather re-written) to allow for a more efficient (and simpler)
`tokens` implementation and addition of completely new primitive
combinators. After that we'll see if it helps with performance.

### `tokens`

Let's start with `tokens`, which is a familiar primitive: `string` and
`string'` are implemented in terms of it. It allows to match a fixed chunk
of stream (that is, several tokens in a row). It also backtracks
automatically in modern versions of Megaparsec, which makes it easier to
just slice and compare a “chunk” of stream directly and efficiently.

There are several possible implementations that would require different
methods to be added to `Stream`. I went with extracting a chunk of fixed
length equal to the length of the chunk we want to match against, then
comparing it using user-supplied function to figure out if what we've
fetched is a match.

The implementation currently looks like this:

```haskell
pTokens :: forall e s m. Stream s
  => (Tokens s -> Tokens s -> Bool)
  -> Tokens s
  -> ParsecT e s m (Tokens s)
pTokens f tts = ParsecT $ \s@(State input (pos:|z) tp w) cok _ _ eerr ->
  let pxy = Proxy :: Proxy s
      unexpect pos' u =
        let us = pure u
            ps = (E.singleton . Tokens . NE.fromList . chunkToTokens pxy) tts
        in TrivialError pos' us ps
      len = chunkLength pxy tts
  in case takeN_ len input of
    Nothing ->
      eerr (unexpect (pos:|z) EndOfInput) s
    Just (tts', input') ->
      if f tts tts'
        then let !npos = advanceN pxy w pos tts'
             in cok tts' (State input' (npos:|z) (tp + len) w) mempty
        else let !apos = positionAtN pxy pos tts'
                 ps = (Tokens . NE.fromList . chunkToTokens pxy) tts'
             in eerr (unexpect (apos:|z) ps) (State input (apos:|z) tp w)
```

If it doesn't make much sense to you, it's OK. The point here is that we
need this `takeN_` primitive to grab N tokens from input stream:

```haskell
-- | Type class for inputs that can be consumed by the library.

class (Ord (Token s), Ord (Tokens s)) => Stream s where

  -- | Type of token in the stream.

  type Token s :: *

  -- | Type of “chunk” of the stream.

  type Tokens s :: *

  -- | Extract a single token form the stream. Return 'Nothing' if the
  -- stream is empty.

  take1_ :: s -> Maybe (Token s, s)

  -- | @'takeN_' n s@ should try to extract a chunk of length @n@, or if the
  -- stream is too short, the rest of the stream. Valid implementation
  -- should follow the rules:
  --
  --     * If the requested length @n@ is 0 (or less), 'Nothing' should
  --       never be returned, instead @'Just' (\"\", s)@ should be returned,
  --       where @\"\"@ stands for the empty chunk, and @s@ is the original
  --       stream (second argument).
  --     * If the requested length is greater than 0 and the stream is
  --       empty, 'Nothing' should be returned indicating end of input.
  --     * In other cases, take chunk of length @n@ (or shorter if the
  --       stream is not long enough) from the input stream and return the
  --       chunk along with the rest of the stream.

  takeN_ :: Int -> s -> Maybe (Tokens s, s)
```

As you can see, `takeN_` returns `Tokens s` thing, where `Tokens` is a new
associated type of the `Stream` type class. It's the same as stream type for
built-in streams (`String`, strict and lazy `Text` and `ByteString`), but it
may be desirable to have something that differs from the stream type `s`
when working with custom streams.

`take1_` is our old workhorse `uncons` under different name—truly the most
common operation in parsing (basis of the `token` primitive), but we'll talk
more about that later when analyzing performance.

`takeN_` is in foundation of `tokens` for another reason as well—we'd like
to keep the number of `Stream`'s methods minimal, and `takeN_` can be used
to implement many useful combinators such as `match`:

```haskell
-- | Return both the result of a parse and the list of tokens that were
-- consumed during parsing. This relies on the change of the
-- 'stateTokensProcessed' value to evaluate how many tokens were consumed.
-- If you mess with it manually in the argument parser, prepare for
-- troubles.
--
-- @since 5.3.0

match :: MonadParsec e s m => m a -> m (Tokens s, a)
match p = do
  tp  <- getTokensProcessed
  s   <- getInput
  r   <- p
  tp' <- getTokensProcessed
  -- NOTE The 'fromJust' call here should never fail because if the stream
  -- is empty before 'p' (the only case when 'takeN_' can return 'Nothing'
  -- as per its invariants), (tp' - tp) won't be greater than 0, and in that
  -- case 'Just' is guaranteed to be returned as per another invariant of
  -- 'takeN_'.
  return ((fst . fromJust) (takeN_ (tp' - tp) s), r)
```

If you look carefully at the definition of `pTokens`, you'll notice more
methods of `Stream`: `positionAtN`, `advanceN`, and `chunkLength`.

```haskell
-- | Type class for inputs that can be consumed by the library.

class (Ord (Token s), Ord (Tokens s)) => Stream s where

  -- …

  -- | Set source position __at__ given token. By default, the given
  -- 'SourcePos' (second argument) is just returned without looking at the
  -- token. This method is important when your stream is a collection of
  -- tokens where every token knows where it begins in the original input.

  positionAt1
    :: Proxy s         -- ^ 'Proxy' clarifying the type of stream
    -> SourcePos       -- ^ Current position
    -> Token s         -- ^ Current token
    -> SourcePos       -- ^ Position of the token
  positionAt1 Proxy = defaultPositionAt

  -- | The same as 'positionAt1', but for chunks of the stream. The function
  -- should return the position where the entire chunk begins. Again, by
  -- default the second argument is returned without modifications and the
  -- chunk is not looked at.

  positionAtN
    :: Proxy s         -- ^ 'Proxy' clarifying the type of stream
    -> SourcePos       -- ^ Current position
    -> Tokens s        -- ^ Current chunk
    -> SourcePos       -- ^ Position of the chunk
  positionAtN Proxy = defaultPositionAt

  -- | Advance position given a single token. The returned position is the
  -- position right after the token, or position where the token ends.

  advance1
    :: Proxy s         -- ^ 'Proxy' clarifying the type of stream
    -> Pos             -- ^ Tab width
    -> SourcePos       -- ^ Current position
    -> Token s         -- ^ Current token
    -> SourcePos       -- ^ Advanced position

  -- | Advance position given a chunk of stream. The returned position is
  -- the position right after the chunk, or position where the chunk ends.

  advanceN
    :: Proxy s         -- ^ 'Proxy' clarifying the type of stream
    -> Pos             -- ^ Tab width
    -> SourcePos       -- ^ Current position
    -> Tokens s        -- ^ Current token
    -> SourcePos       -- ^ Advanced position

  -- | Return length of a chunk of the stream.

  chunkLength :: Proxy s -> Tokens s -> Int
```

`positionAt1` and `positionAtN` set position at single token and given chunk
of stream respectively. For all the built-in streams it's enough to just
return the given source position:

```haskell
defaultPositionAt :: SourcePos -> a -> SourcePos
defaultPositionAt pos _ = pos
```

Because in input like `aaab`, if we have matched all `a`s, we are
automatically at `b`'s position—that's it. The methods are more useful for
streams of tokens where every token contains its position in original input,
for example:

```haskell
data Span = Span
  { spanStart :: SourcePos
  , spanEnd   :: SourcePos
  , spanBody  :: NonEmpty Char
  } deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

instance Stream [Span] where
  type Token [Span] = Span
  type Tokens [Span] = [Span]
  positionAt1 Proxy _ (Span start _ _) = start
  positionAtN Proxy pos [] = pos
  positionAtN Proxy _ (Span start _ _:_) = start
  advance1 Proxy _ _ (Span _ end _) = end
  advanceN Proxy _ pos [] = pos
  advanceN Proxy _ _ ts =
    let Span _ end _ = last ts in end
  chunkLength Proxy = length
  take1_ [] = Nothing
  take1_ (t:ts) = Just (t, ts)
  takeN_ n s
    | n <= 0   = Just ([], s)
    | null s   = Nothing
    | otherwise = Just (splitAt n s)
```

`advance1` and `advanceN` position stream right after parsed token or chunk.
For built-in streams `advanceN` is just defined via `advance1` and a strict
left fold over given chunk.

`chunkLength` should be obvious—without it we wouldn't be able to keep track
of the total number of processed tokens.

### Isomorphism between `[Token s]` and `Tokens s`

Let's see more methods of `Stream`:

```haskell
-- | Type class for inputs that can be consumed by the library.

class (Ord (Token s), Ord (Tokens s)) => Stream s where

  -- …

  -- | The first method that establishes isomorphism between list of tokens
  -- and chunk of the stream. Valid implementation should satisfy:
  --
  -- > chunkToTokens pxy (tokensToChunk pxy ts) == ts

  tokensToChunk :: Proxy s -> [Token s] -> Tokens s

  -- | The second method that establishes isomorphism between list of tokens
  -- and chunk of the stream. Valid implementation should satisfy:
  --
  -- > tokensToChunk pxy (chunkToTokens pxy chunk) == chunk

  chunkToTokens :: Proxy s -> Tokens s -> [Token s]
```

`chunkToTokens` is primarily necessary to report chunks of input in parse
errors. There will be a different blog post about changes related to parse
errors, but it suffices to say that unexpected and expected tokens are
`ErrorItem`s, defined like this:

```haskell
data ErrorItem t
  = Tokens (NonEmpty t)      -- ^ Non-empty stream of tokens
  | Label (NonEmpty Char)    -- ^ Label (cannot be empty)
  | EndOfInput               -- ^ End of input
```

This removes weird errors like `unexpected ""` or `expecting ""` and merges
one token/many tokens case into the single constructor `Tokens (NonEmpty t)`
simplifying error reporting and making it more uniform (you can't get
different renderings of essentially the same thing like `"a"` and `'a'`, if
there is one token, it's always formatted `'a'`, if there are more tokens,
string-like syntax is used: `"aa"`).

To get `NonEmpty t`, we need to get `[Token s]` (remember `t ~ Token s`), so
that's what `chunkToTokens` is for. (Don't worry, because of the
requirements we state for `takeN_`, `NE.fromList` never blows up in
`pTokens`).

There are reasons to request also `tokensToChunk`—that is, mapping in the
opposite direction. Here is a motivating example:

```haskell
-- | Parse a carriage return character followed by a newline character.
-- Return the sequence of characters parsed.

crlf :: forall e s m. (MonadParsec e s m, Token s ~ Char) => m (Tokens s)
crlf = string (tokensToChunk (Proxy :: Proxy s) "\r\n")

-- reminder:

string :: MonadParsec e s m => Tokens s -> m (Tokens s)
string = tokens (==)
```

`string` takes `Tokens s`, but if we add constraint like `Tokens s ~ Text`,
`crlf` will be useful with only one type of input stream. We can just
request that `Token s ~ Char` if we can convert list of tokens `[Char]` to
the chunk type. This way, the same `crlf` function works out-of-the-box with
`String`, strict and lazy `Text`, and any other `Stream` instance with
`Token s ~ Char` that user may add. (We could go with `IsString (Tokens s)`,
in this particular case but it's a less-general solution because tokens may
have nothing to do with characters and `IsString` may make no sense for
`Tokens s` type).

So for instances of `Stream` we request that list of tokens `[Token s]` and
`Tokens s` are isomorphic with `tokensToChunk` and `chunkToTokens` acting as
a way to switch representations:

```haskell
chunkToTokens pxy (tokensToChunk pxy ts)    == ts
tokensToChunk pxy (chunkToTokens pxy chunk) == chunk
```

One special case is lifting single token to the chunk type, like in this
`eol` parser:

```haskell
-- | Parse a CRLF (see 'crlf') or LF (see 'newline') end of line. Return the
-- sequence of characters parsed.

eol :: forall e s m. (MonadParsec e s m, Token s ~ Char) => m (Tokens s)
eol = (tokenToChunk (Proxy :: Proxy s) <$> newline)
  <|> crlf
  <?> "end of line"
```

“Common denominator” return type of `newline :: m (Token s)` and `crlf :: m
(Tokens s)` is certainly `Tokens s`. No problem, we could use `tokensToChunk
(Proxy @s) . pure`, but it feels like a shame to do that when there are
`singleton` functions that do the conversion in a list-free fashion, so we
add `tokenToChunk` to `Stream` as well.

### `takeWhileP`, `takeWhile1P`, and `takeP`

We've got 10 methods in `Stream` type class now. That's (unfortunately) not
enough. Our aim is to add the following very useful primitives found in
Attoparsec: `takeWhile`, `takeWhile1`, and `take`. They all should return
chunks of input without repacking just like `tokens` does.

Let's start with `takeWhile` and write its signature:

```haskell
takeWhile :: MonadParsec e s m => (Token s -> Bool) -> m (Tokens s)
```

Looks about right? With Attoparsec it's OK to go with this one, but there
are subtle details related to quality of parse errors that we cannot neglect
in Megaparsec, so the signature will be a bit different.

The problem here is that we know nothing about these `Token s` things for
which the predicate returns `True`. Without that information parse errors
will suck. You may be thinking now that adding `(<?>)` could save the
situation:

```haskell
space = takeWhile isSpace <?> "white space"
```

The idiom is valid and has its uses, but it's not quite the same as:

```haskell
space = many spaceChar
  where
    spaceChar = satisfy isSpace <?> "white space"
```

To understand why, we need to remember that when we match a row of tokens
and then fail right after that we should not forget that there could be more
of those tokens before the position where we failed at, to illustrate:

```haskell
λ> parseTest (many spaceChar <* eof) "  a"
1:3:
unexpected 'a'
expecting end of input or white space
```

Megaparsec keeps track of those “possible” matches using something called
*hints*. (Parsec passes around dummy parse errors from which only “expected”
component is used with the same result.) They are created when something
fails without consuming input in context of a bigger combinator (typically
alternatives with `(<|>)`) that itself succeeds and are kept until more
input is consumed, then they are discarded by Megaparsec's machinery:

```haskell
λ> parseTest (many spaceChar <* many (char 'b') <* eof) "  a"
1:3:
unexpected 'a'
expecting 'b', end of input, or white space
λ> parseTest (many spaceChar <* many (char 'b') <* eof) "  ba"
1:3:
unexpected 'a'
expecting 'b' or end of input
```

Furthermore, this is different from labeling the whole thing (I don't bother
to convert the chars to actual number here):

```haskell
λ> parseTest ((some digitChar <?> "integer") <* eof) "123a"
1:4:
unexpected 'a'
expecting end of input or the rest of integer
```

This “the rest of integer” phrase is different from just “digit”, so it's a
different thing.

We want to label those individual tokens matched by `takeWhile` even though
our parsing code never really gets to manipulate them “normally”. So a
better signature is probably something like this:

```haskell
  -- | Parse /zero/ or more tokens for which the supplied predicate holds.
  -- Try to use this as much as possible because for many streams the
  -- combinator is much faster than parsers built with 'many' and
  -- 'Text.Megaparsec.Char.satisfy'.
  --
  -- The following equations should clarify the behavior:
  --
  -- > takeWhileP (Just "foo") f = many (satisfy f <?> "foo")
  -- > takeWhileP Nothing      f = many (satisfy f)
  --
  -- The combinator never fails, although it may parse an empty chunk.
  --
  -- @since 6.0.0

  takeWhileP
    :: Maybe String    -- ^ Name for a single token in the row
    -> (Token s -> Bool) -- ^ Predicate to use to test tokens
    -> m (Tokens s)    -- ^ A chunk of matching tokens
```

We can make the normal “hints” machinery deal with the label and it's still
possible to label the whole thing with `(<?>)` for a slightly different
result.

Since Megaparsec is typically imported unqualified, the “P” suffix should
prevent name collisions with the standard list functions from prelude.

Implementation of `takeWhileP`:

```haskell
pTakeWhileP :: forall e s m. Stream s
  => Maybe String
  -> (Token s -> Bool)
  -> ParsecT e s m (Tokens s)
pTakeWhileP ml f = ParsecT $ \(State input (pos:|z) tp w) cok _ eok _ ->
  let pxy = Proxy :: Proxy s
      (ts, input') = takeWhile_ f input
      !npos = advanceN pxy w pos ts
      len = chunkLength pxy ts
      hs =
        case ml >>= NE.nonEmpty of
          Nothing -> mempty
          Just l -> (Hints . pure . E.singleton . Label) l
  in if chunkEmpty pxy ts
       then eok ts (State input' (npos:|z) (tp + len) w) hs
       else cok ts (State input' (npos:|z) (tp + len) w) hs
```

Nothing new, except we need to add `takeWhile_` to the `Stream` type class
because it's not expressible via what we have so far. Another addition is
`chunkEmpty` because we want to use the correct continuation (`eok` when
nothing has been consumed and `cok` otherwise):

```haskell
-- | Type class for inputs that can be consumed by the library.

class (Ord (Token s), Ord (Tokens s)) => Stream s where

  -- …

  -- | Check if a chunk of the stream is empty. The default implementation
  -- is in terms of the more general 'chunkLength':
  --
  -- > chunkEmpty pxy ts = chunkLength pxy ts <= 0
  --
  -- However for many streams there may be a more efficient implementation.

  chunkEmpty :: Proxy s -> Tokens s -> Bool
  chunkEmpty pxy ts = chunkLength pxy ts <= 0

  -- | Extract chunk of the stream taking tokens while the supplied
  -- predicate returns 'True'. Return the chunk and the rest of the stream.
  --
  -- For many types of streams, the method allows for significant
  -- performance improvements, although it is not strictly necessary from
  -- conceptual point of view.

  takeWhile_ :: (Token s -> Bool) -> s -> (Tokens s, s)
```

Now `Stream` is complete. It's still not hard to make a type an instance of
`Stream`, for example:

```haskell
instance Stream String where
  type Token String = Char
  type Tokens String = String
  tokenToChunk Proxy = pure
  tokensToChunk Proxy = id
  chunkToTokens Proxy = id
  chunkLength Proxy = length
  chunkEmpty Proxy = null
  advance1 Proxy = defaultAdvance1
  advanceN Proxy w = foldl' (defaultAdvance1 w)
  take1_ [] = Nothing
  take1_ (t:ts) = Just (t, ts)
  takeN_ n s
    | n <= 0    = Just ("", s)
    | null s    = Nothing
    | otherwise = Just (splitAt n s)
  takeWhile_ = span

instance Stream T.Text where
  type Token T.Text = Char
  type Tokens T.Text = T.Text
  tokenToChunk Proxy = T.singleton
  tokensToChunk Proxy = T.pack
  chunkToTokens Proxy = T.unpack
  chunkLength Proxy = T.length
  chunkEmpty Proxy = T.null
  advance1 Proxy = defaultAdvance1
  advanceN Proxy w = T.foldl' (defaultAdvance1 w)
  take1_ = T.uncons
  takeN_ n s
    | n <= 0    = Just (T.empty, s)
    | T.null s  = Nothing
    | otherwise = Just (T.splitAt n s)
  takeWhile_ = T.span

-- etc.
```

`takeWhile1P` requires at least one matching token:

```haskell
  -- | Similar to 'takeWhileP', but fails if it can't parse at least one
  -- token. Note that the combinator either succeeds or fails without
  -- consuming any input, so 'try' is not necessary with it.
  --
  -- @since 6.0.0

  takeWhile1P
    :: Maybe String    -- ^ Name for a single token in the row
    -> (Token s -> Bool) -- ^ Predicate to use to test tokens
    -> m (Tokens s)    -- ^ A chunk of matching tokens
```

And `takeP` accepts precise number of tokens to consume as an argument:

```haskell
  -- | Extract the specified number of tokens from the input stream and
  -- return them packed as a chunk of stream. If there is not enough tokens
  -- in the stream, a parse error will be signaled. It's guaranteed that if
  -- the parser succeeds, the requested number of tokens will be returned.
  --
  -- The parser is roughly equivalent to:
  --
  -- > takeP (Just "foo") n = count n (anyChar <?> "foo")
  -- > takeP Nothing      n = count n anyChar
  --
  -- Note that if the combinator fails due to insufficient number of tokens
  -- in the input stream, it backtracks automatically. No 'try' is necessary
  -- with 'takeP'.
  --
  -- @since 6.0.0

  takeP
    :: Maybe String    -- ^ Name for a single token in the row
    -> Int             -- ^ How many tokens to extract
    -> m (Tokens s)    -- ^ A chunk of matching tokens
```

We won't look at the implementations (which also may be not totally obvious)
because they do not introduce anything of interest.

## When `String` is a more efficient type than `Text`

People often claim that `Text` is more efficient than `String` and “serious”
code should prefer `Text` and `ByteString`, because `String` is for suckers.
Well, it depends.

To judge capabilities of our new code, we must understand which operations
are efficient with `ByteString` and `Text` and which are not, and how to use
the efficient ones to maximum benefit . There is no magic to make things
faster just because we started to parse `Text` instead of `String`.

The terrifying truth: if your parser (Megaparsec or Parsec) parses `String`
and you just switch to `Text`, chances are the performance will degrade.

Surprised? Here are the facts:

* Unconsing is the most common operation that is performed on input stream.
  This is because most of the time we need fine-grained control that forces
  us to consume and analyze one token at a time.

* `String` is a list of characters `[Char]`, the characters are already
  there. No need to allocate a `Char` every time and `uncons` is a very
  efficient operation for lists.

* `Text` is `data Text = Text Array Int Int` (omitting unboxing pragmas). No
  `Char`s here. Every time we uncons we need to do a lot more work and
  allocate new `Char`. It's slower.

And here are the benchmarks (made with current Megaparsec master):

Note how even though max residency with `String` is higher, it allocates
less than `Text`.

So, has Attoparsec gone wrong by not supporting `String`? How do we save
prestige of `Text` and `ByteString`?

## There is hope…

It's true that unconsing is slow, but there are other operations that are
fast. Good news is that we have just wrapped some of them as `takeN_` and
`takeWhile_`.

Efficient operations are typically those that produce `Text` from `Text` and
`ByteString` from `ByteString`. In other words the primitives that return
`Tokens s` instead of `Token s` are fast.

Attoparsec does not make a secret as to where the source of its speed lies
(quoting
[the docs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec/docs/Data-Attoparsec-Text.html)):

> Use the `Text`-oriented parsers whenever possible, e.g. `takeWhile1`
  instead of `many1 anyChar`. There is about a factor of 100 difference in
  performance between the two kinds of parser.

*This is important.* Let me show you a picture:

Now that Megaparsec has grown the same sort of “muscle” as Attoparsec, will
it make a difference?

## Case study: Stache parser

While writing the post, I decided to compare a real-world Megaparsec 5
parser with its upgraded version. The switch wasn't mechanic, I needed to
take advantage of the new combinators to improve the speed.

[Here is a PR](https://github.com/stackbuilders/stache/pull/22), I won't
quote the diffs here, but I'll list results of the switch:

* I wanted `string` to return strict `Text`, so changing input type to
  strict `Text` was necessary. Not a big deal.

* The new design forces the user to be more consistent with data types
  he/she is using. Previously I had a mix of `String` and `Text`. Now
  everything is strict `Text`. Which is a good thing.

* Performance: judging by “comprehensive template” benchmark, the new parser
  is 43% faster than the old one. You can clone the repo and run the
  benchmark yourself for more info (the `master` branch can be used to see
  performance before the switch).

If you do a mechanical switch to Megaparsec 6, you still may get performance
improvements (provided you don't switch from `String` to `Text` without
knowing what you are doing):

* If you happen to use `string` a lot, you'll see an improvement.

* If you use combinators like `space` from `Text.Megaparsec.Char` and
  `skipLineComment` from `Text.Megaparsec.Char.Lexer`, you'll find that they
  are faster now because they were re-implemented in terms of `takeWhileP`.

Still, most of the time manual tuning is necessary to get the most of the
new combinators.

## Back to Megaparsec vs Attoparsec

Ah yeah, I've almost forgotten, we're “competing” with Attoparsec here.

To update the code to Megaparsec 6 I put `takeWhileP` and `takeWhile1P` in a
couple of places, added inline pragmas that I initially forgot for the same
functions as in Attoparsec's JSON parser. I also followed the good advice
from Attoparsec's docs:

> For very simple character-testing predicates, write them by hand instead
  of using `inClass` or `notInClass`.

(“By hand” means with `satisfy`. `inClass` in called `oneOf` in Megaparsec
and `notInClass`—`noneOf`.)

Then I profiled the parsers and found out that numeric helpers like
`decimal` can be a nasty bottleneck. I'll save your time and won't show the
details here. Right now I'm working on a PR that should heavily optimize all
numeric parsers in Megaparsec (let's say “no” to `read`-based
implementations!). At the time of writing it's not ready yet, but I've put
faster implementations of `decimal` and `scientific` (borrowed mostly from
Attoparsec source) right into the `parsers-bench` repo. We'll have something
as efficient in Megaparsec once I finish with that PR.

I've got the following results:

![Megaparsec vs Attoparsec (after optimizations)](/static/img/megaatto-final.png)

I'm quite embarrassed about the JSON parser. I'm not sure why on the earth
it's even faster than Attoparsec. I tried it by hand and it looks that it
produces valid results, i.e. it works. The style is not most natural, but
that's the style Attoparsec uses so it's only fair to preserve it (we
compare libraries, not styles). It may be some sort of mistake on my part,
and I hope someone clever will point out what it is as soon as I publish the
post. Again, all the code is here:
<https://github.com/mrkkrp/parsers-bench>, so please be my guest.

## Conclusion

Megaparsec in version 6 has acquired (or will acquire, upon release) some
appeal that was unique to Attoparsec before. Now we have a collection of
parsers that are 100–150× faster than standard approaches using traditional
combinators like `many` and `token`-based parsers. We also avoid repacking
results of `token`-based parsers as list of tokens (e.g. `String`) if we
parse things like `Text`. Megaparsec has to do more bookkeeping to provide
better error messages, but if these fast combinators are put into use like
it's the case with Attoparsec parsers, the difference with Attoparsec is not
that dramatic is it's usually thought.

Attoparsec still has its uses though: it's still faster and supports
incremental parsing properly. That said, with Megaparsec 6 released I'll be
more hesitant to use Attoparsec because it's easier to use one library for
everything, especially if it's more powerful and not much slower.

The version 6 thus will aim to be not just a parser for human-readable texts
and source code, but “one size fits all” general solution to parsing in
Haskell, including low-level binary parsing.

If you want to play with version 6 (it probably won't be released for
another month), use something like this `stack.yaml` file:

```yaml
resolver: lts-8.20

- '.'
