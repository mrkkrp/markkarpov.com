  phantom types etc.): EDSL using combinators, GADTs, type-level
  programming, generics, TH, high-performance Haskell, parallel and
  concurrent Haskell, lens (van Laarhoven/profunctor).

* Libraries (not mentioning vital common libs like `monad-control` and
  `base`): `lens`, `aeson`, `conduit`, `postgresql-simple`, `persistent`,

  monadic parser combinator library.

* [Req](https://github.com/mrkkrp/req)—Easy-to-use, type-safe, expandable,
  high-level HTTP library.

## Writing

* I've authored a number of tutorials as part of my job and on my own, see
  e.g. [GHC optimization and
  fusion](https://www.stackbuilders.com/tutorials/haskell/ghc-optimization-and-fusion/),
  the full list is available at https://markkarpov.com/learn-haskell.html.

* Blog posts are available [here](https://markkarpov.com/posts.html), see
  e.g. [Megaparsec: more speed, more
  power](https://markkarpov.com/post/megaparsec-more-speed-more-power.html)
  from the recent ones.

* I've authored two chapters for the upcoming book [Intermediate
  Haskell](https://intermediatehaskell.com/): Exceptions and Megaparsec.
  Unfortunately the content is not publicly available yet (only available to
