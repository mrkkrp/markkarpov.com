***

The sun is hot. \
The earth is small. \
The universe is heavy. \
And time goes only forward. \
While I'm here, it's all for me to know. \
When I cross the line, all of it will elude me.

*February 1, 2020*

***

I'm fine, thank you. \
It is a perfect day in the center of summer. \
Aquamarine grades into ultramarine in the ocean. \
The sparkling white is in the open. \
I look at the waves and I walk. \
There are the pebbles and there is the rocky shore. \
A lonely boat with a triangular sail's offshore. \
In the hypermarine of today.

I want this day. \
In photos and music, in memory and in my backpack. \
I face the wind and the wind wears out the mind. \
My thoughts flee to hide high in the sky. \
I focus, imagine immemorial. \
Details defront in bokeh. \
Do I mind? I mark the day as mine.

***

It is simple \
As it has always been \
I can breathe \
And the light is suddenly strong \
Spring is a song \
With a long fade in \
Beginning in January

***

Remove the chores \
Remove the needs \
And there it stares at you \
The horror \
The machine that keeps elemental particles stable \
Two eyes glistering in the background \
The machine that has sentenced you \
Blink
