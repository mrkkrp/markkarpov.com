## Summary

I'm a software engineer specializing in functional programming using strong
static type systems. I work as a consultant helping our clients design and
build correct, robust, and maintainable software. Being a consultant allows
me to participate in more projects that a typical software engineer gets to
work on. I have developed the ability for critical thinking, making wise
trade-offs, analyzing and exploiting advantages of various technologies to
satisfy needs of businesses. My personal projects include high-profile
Haskell libraries, tutorials, and a technical blog.
