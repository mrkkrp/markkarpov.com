## Summary

Software engineer specializing in functional programming using strong static
type systems, in Haskell in particular.

I strive to build systems that are simple, maintainable, easy to understand,
and future-proof. Experience has taught me that the work is about exploiting
strong sides of Haskell to achieve balance between simplicity and safety. It
is also about happiness of developers and efficient conversion of money into
value, rather than type-level acrobatics or proving how clever we can be.

## Tech work experience

* **January 14, 2019–present** Senior software engineer at
  [Tweag](https://tweag.io), Paris, France.

* **January 25, 2018–January 11, 2019** Software engineer at
  [Tweag](https://tweag.io) (remote). Worked as a consultant with a number
  of clients, helped developing Bazel rules for Haskell.

* **May 4, 2016–May 20, 2017** Tier 2 Haskell developer at [Stack
  Builders](https://www.stackbuilders.com/) (remote). The job involved
  working for several clients mostly from the US. Web-applications built
  with Yesod, Snap, Servant (including a micro-service based system with
  Servant on backend). Agile. Another part of the job was writing tutorials
  and blog posts to increase visibility of the company.

## Haskell

I've worked using Haskell on daily basis for 5 years. I used it to build
open source projects and to help a number of clients build their products.
In both cases I got continuous positive feedback throughout my career.

## Nix

I started using Nix in 2018 when I joined Tweag. I use Nix and NixOS on
daily basis and continue improving my Nix skills.

## Technologies

* Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL.
* AWS.
* Linux server.
* Docker.
* Strong knowledge of Git.
* CI: Travis CI, Circle CI.
* Dependent types, theorem provers: Coq.
* Bash/Python/Haskell scripting.
* Build systems: make, shake, Bazel.
* Server automation: Ansible.
* Front-end: HTML (5), CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript (jQuery, AJAX,
  websockets).
