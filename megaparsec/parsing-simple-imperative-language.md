This tutorial will present how to parse a subset of a simple imperative
programming language called *WHILE* (introduced in the book “Principles of
Program Analysis” by Nielson, Nielson and Hankin). It includes only a few
statements and basic boolean/arithmetic expressions, which makes it nice
material for a tutorial.

## Imports

First let's import the necessary modules:

```haskell
module Main where

import Control.Monad (void)
import Data.Void
import Text.Megaparsec
import Text.Megaparsec.Char
import Text.Megaparsec.Expr
import qualified Text.Megaparsec.Char.Lexer as L
```

## The language

The grammar for expressions is defined as follows:

```
a   ::= x | n | - a | a opa a
b   ::= true | false | not b | b opb b | a opr a
opa ::= + | - | * | /
opb ::= and | or
opr ::= > | <
```

Note that we have three groups of operators: arithmetic, Boolean and
relational ones.

And now the definition of statements:

```
S ::= x := a | skip | S1; S2 | ( S ) | if b then S1 else S2 | while b do S
```

We probably want to parse that into some internal representation of the
language (an [abstract syntax
tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)). Therefore we
need to define the data structures for the expressions and statements.

## Data structures

We need to take care of Boolean and arithmetic expressions and the
appropriate operators. First let's look at the Boolean expressions:

```haskell
data BExpr
  = BoolConst Bool
  | Not BExpr
  | BBinary BBinOp BExpr BExpr
  | RBinary RBinOp AExpr AExpr
  deriving (Show)
```

Binary Boolean operators:

```haskell
data BBinOp
  = And
  | Or
  deriving (Show)
```

Relational operators:

```haskell
data RBinOp
  = Greater
  | Less
  deriving (Show)
```

Now we define the types for arithmetic expressions:

```haskell
data AExpr
  = Var String
  | IntConst Integer
  | Neg AExpr
  | ABinary ABinOp AExpr AExpr
  deriving (Show)
```

…and arithmetic operators:

```haskell
data ABinOp
  = Add
  | Subtract
  | Multiply
  | Divide
  deriving (Show)
```

Finally let's take care of the statements:

```haskell
data Stmt
  = Seq [Stmt]
  | Assign String AExpr
  | If BExpr Stmt Stmt
  | While BExpr Stmt
  | Skip
  deriving (Show)
```

Since we don't need custom data in error messages and our input stream will
be in the form of a `String`, the following definition of `Parser` will do:

```haskell
type Parser = Parsec Void String
```

## Lexer

Having all the data structures we can go on with writing the code to do the
actual parsing. Here we will define *lexemes* of our language. When writing
a lexer for a language it's always important to define what counts as
whitespace and how it should be consumed. `space` from
`Text.Megaparsec.Char.Lexer` module can be helpful here:

```haskell
sc :: Parser ()
sc = L.space space1 lineCmnt blockCmnt
  where
    lineCmnt  = L.skipLineComment "//"
    blockCmnt = L.skipBlockComment "/*" "*/"
```

`sc` stands for “space consumer”. `space` takes three arguments: a parser
that parses whitespace (but it should not accept empty input), a parser for
line comments, and a parser for block (multi-line) comments.
`skipLineComment` and `skipBlockComment` help with parsers that consume
comments. (If our language didn't have block comments, we could pass `empty`
from `Control.Applicative` as the third argument of `space`.)

Next, we will follow the strategy where whitespace will be consumed *after*
every lexeme automatically, but not before it. Let's define a wrapper to
achieve this:

```haskell
lexeme :: Parser a -> Parser a
lexeme = L.lexeme sc
```

Perfect. Now we can wrap any parser in `lexeme` and it will consume any
trailing whitespace with `sc`.

Since we often want to parse some “fixed” string, let's define one more
parser called `symbol`. It will take a string as argument and parse this
string and whitespace after it.

```haskell
symbol :: String -> Parser String
symbol = L.symbol sc
```

With these tools we can create other useful parsers:

```haskell
-- | 'parens' parses something between parenthesis.

parens :: Parser a -> Parser a
parens = between (symbol "(") (symbol ")")

-- | 'integer' parses an integer.

integer :: Parser Integer
integer = lexeme L.decimal

-- | 'semi' parses a semicolon.

semi :: Parser String
semi = symbol ";"
```

To parse various operators we can just use `symbol`, but reserved words and
identifiers are a bit trickier. There are two things to note:

* Parsers for reserved words should check that the parsed reserved word is
  not a prefix of an identifier.

* Parsers of identifiers should check that parsed identifier is not a
  reserved word.

Let's express it in code:

```haskell
rword :: String -> Parser ()
rword w = lexeme (string w *> notFollowedBy alphaNumChar)

rws :: [String] -- list of reserved words
rws = ["if","then","else","while","do","skip","true","false","not","and","or"]

identifier :: Parser String
identifier = (lexeme . try) (p >>= check)
  where
    p       = (:) <$> letterChar <*> many alphaNumChar
    check x = if x `elem` rws
                then fail $ "keyword " ++ show x ++ " cannot be an identifier"
                else return x
```

`identifier` may seem complex, but it's actually simple. We just parse a
sequence of characters where the first character is a letter and the rest is
several characters where every one of them can be either a letter or a
digit. Once we have parsed such a string, we check if it's in the list of
reserved words, fail with an informative message if it is, and return the
result otherwise.

Note the use of `try` in `identifier`. This is necessary to backtrack to
beginning of the identifier in cases when `fail` is evaluated. Otherwise
things like `many identifier` would fail on such identifiers instead of just
stopping.

And that's it, we have just written the lexer for our language, now we can
start writing the parser.

## Parser

As already mentioned, a program in this language is simply a statement, so
the main parser should basically only parse a statement. But we must
remember to take care of initial whitespace—our parsers only get rid of
whitespace *after* the tokens!

```haskell
whileParser :: Parser Stmt
whileParser = between sc eof stmt
```

Now because any statement might be actually a sequence of statements
separated by semicolons, we use `sepBy1` to parse at least one statement.
The result is a list of statements. We also allow grouping statements with
parentheses, which is useful, for instance, in the `while` loop.

```haskell
stmt :: Parser Stmt
stmt = f <$> sepBy1 stmt' semi
  where
    -- if there's only one stmt return it without using ‘Seq’
    f l = if length l == 1 then head l else Seq l
```

Now a single statement is quite simple, it's either an `if` conditional, a
`while` loop, an assignment or simply a `skip` statement. We use `<|>` to
express choice. So `a <|> b` will first try parser `a` and if it fails
(without actually consuming any input) then parser `b` will be used. *Note:
this means that the order is important.*

```haskell
stmt' :: Parser Stmt
stmt' = ifStmt
  <|> whileStmt
  <|> skipStmt
  <|> assignStmt
  <|> parens stmt
```

If you have a parser that might fail after consuming some input, and you
still want to try the next parser, you should take a look at the `try`
combinator. For instance `try p <|> q` will try parsing with `p` and if it
fails, even after consuming the input, the `q` parser will be used as if
nothing has been consumed by `p`.

Now let's define the parsers for all the possible statements. This is quite
straightforward as we just use the parsers from the lexer and then use all
the necessary information to create appropriate data structures.

```haskell
ifStmt :: Parser Stmt
ifStmt = do
  rword "if"
  cond  <- bExpr
  rword "then"
  stmt1 <- stmt
  rword "else"
  stmt2 <- stmt
  return (If cond stmt1 stmt2)

whileStmt :: Parser Stmt
whileStmt = do
  rword "while"
  cond <- bExpr
  rword "do"
  stmt1 <- stmt
  return (While cond stmt1)

assignStmt :: Parser Stmt
assignStmt = do
  var  <- identifier
  void (symbol ":=")
  expr <- aExpr
  return (Assign var expr)

skipStmt :: Parser Stmt
skipStmt = Skip <$ rword "skip"
```

We don't need `try` with these alternatives because `rword` matches on
keyword (such as `if`, `while`, `skip`) using `string` which backtracks
automatically. `identifier` already has `try` in its definition.

## Expressions

What's left is to parse the expressions. Fortunately Megaparsec provides an
easy way to do that. Let's define the arithmetic and Boolean expressions:

```haskell
aExpr :: Parser AExpr
aExpr = makeExprParser aTerm aOperators

bExpr :: Parser BExpr
bExpr = makeExprParser bTerm bOperators
```

Now we have to define the lists with operator precedence, associativity and
what constructors to use in each case.

```haskell
aOperators :: [[Operator Parser AExpr]]
aOperators =
  [ [Prefix (Neg <$ symbol "-") ]
  , [ InfixL (ABinary Multiply <$ symbol "*")
    , InfixL (ABinary Divide   <$ symbol "/") ]
  , [ InfixL (ABinary Add      <$ symbol "+")
    , InfixL (ABinary Subtract <$ symbol "-") ]
  ]

bOperators :: [[Operator Parser BExpr]]
bOperators =
  [ [Prefix (Not <$ rword "not") ]
  , [InfixL (BBinary And <$ rword "and")
    , InfixL (BBinary Or <$ rword "or") ]
  ]
```

In the case of prefix operators it is enough to specify which one should be
parsed and what is the associated data constructor. Infix operators are
defined similarly, but there are several variants of infix constructors for
various associativity options. Note that the operator precedence depends
only on the order of the elements in the list.

Finally we have to define the terms. In the case of arithmetic expressions,
it is quite simple:

```haskell
aTerm :: Parser AExpr
aTerm = parens aExpr
  <|> Var      <$> identifier
  <|> IntConst <$> integer
```

However, a term in a Boolean expression is a bit more tricky. In this case,
a term can also be an expression with relational operator consisting of
arithmetic expressions.

```haskell
bTerm :: Parser BExpr
bTerm =  parens bExpr
  <|> (BoolConst True  <$ rword "true")
  <|> (BoolConst False <$ rword "false")
  <|> rExpr
```

Therefore we have to define a parser for relational expressions:

```haskell
rExpr :: Parser BExpr
rExpr = do
  a1 <- aExpr
  op <- relation
  a2 <- aExpr
  return (RBinary op a1 a2)

relation :: Parser RBinOp
relation = (symbol ">" *> pure Greater)
  <|> (symbol "<" *> pure Less)
```

And that's it. We have a quite simple parser which is able to parse a few
statements and arithmetic/boolean expressions.

## Notes

If you want to experiment with the parser inside GHCi, these functions might
be handy:

* `parseTest p input` applies parser `p` on input `input` and prints
  results.
* `parseTest' p input` is the same as `parseTest`, but also displays
  offending line as part of error message.
