## Summary

I am a software engineer who applies the principles of functional
programming to solve real-world problems. I have been working as a
consultant in the domain of functional programming, reproducible build
systems, and Nix for more than 7 years. My personal projects include
high-profile Haskell libraries, tutorials, and a technical blog.

## Professional experience

* January 14, 2019–present. Senior software engineer at
  [Tweag](https://tweag.io), Paris, France. Tweag is a software consultancy
  built around a number of things: Haskell and FP in general,
  [Nix](https://nixos.org/), Scalable Build systems (think
  [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)), and data science to name a few. I have
  spent almost 6 years at Tweag and worked with a wide range of clients,
  consistently getting positive feedback, exploring the industry through
  working on diverse client projects, and continuously learning. Other than
  doing many FP and Bazel/Nix-related projects, I have had the experience of
  shaping the company in various ways (e.g. introducing knowledge sharing
  sessions, book budget, and other initiatives), interviewing a lot of
  candidates, leading teams both at Tweag internally and in the context of
  client projects, being a hive supporter, and being a blog editor.
* January 25, 2018–January 11, 2019. Software engineer at Tweag (remote).
* May 4, 2016–May 20, 2017. Tier 2 Haskell developer at [Stack
  Builders](https://www.stackbuilders.com/) (remote).

## Open source

I have been active in open source for the last 8 years or so. Here are top 3
projects that highlight my work:

* [Ormolu](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu)—A formatter for Haskell source
  code.
* [Megaparsec](https://github.com/mrkkrp/megaparsec)—Industrial-strength
  monadic parser combinator library.
* [Req](https://github.com/mrkkrp/req)—An HTTP client library.

The full list can be found at <https://markkarpov.com/oss.html>.

## Writing

* I have authored a number of tutorials as part of my job and on my own, see
  <https://markkarpov.com/learn-haskell.html>.
* Blog posts are available at <https://markkarpov.com/posts.html>, see e.g.
  [“How to keep a Bazel project
  hermetic”](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-09-15-hermetic-bazel/).

## Technologies

* Haskell.
* Nix is one of the main technologies we use at Tweag. I run NixOS as my
  primary OS and use Nix daily in my work and for personal projects.
* Build systems (did a number of client projects, notably related to Bazel).
* Strong knowledge of Git.
* DevOps experience (knowledge of some technologies in this area may be
  rusty).
* AWS and GCP.
* Docker.
* CI: GitHub actions, Travis CI, Circle CI, Buildkite.
* Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL.
* Linux server.
* Other languages I know: OCaml, C, C++, Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp, Python.

## Soft skills

* The experience of leading teams.
* The ability to work with people with diverse personalities and skill
  levels.
* Good communicator.
* I speak Russian (native), English (fluent), and French (intermediate).

## Education

* 2009–2014—Polzunov Altai State Technical University. Engineer degree in
  informational technology and measuring engineering.
