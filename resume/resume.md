## Summary

I am a software engineer who applies the principles of functional
programming to solve real-world problems. I have been working as a
consultant in the domain of reproducible build systems, functional
programming, and Nix for more than 7 years. My personal projects include
high-profile Haskell libraries, tutorials, and a technical blog.

## Professional experience

* 2023–2024. Principal consultant at Tweag. Primarily Bazel consulting for
  big industrial users of this build system. Tweag is a software consultancy
  built around a number of things: Haskell and FP in general,
  [Nix](https://nixos.org/), Scalable Build systems (think
  [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)), and data science to name a few. I have
  spent 7 years at Tweag and worked with a wide range of clients,
  consistently getting positive feedback, exploring the industry through
  working on diverse client projects, and continuously learning. Other than
  doing many FP and Bazel/Nix-related projects, I have had the experience of
  shaping the company in various ways (e.g. introducing knowledge sharing
  sessions, book budget, and other initiatives), interviewing many
  candidates for engineering positions, leading teams both at Tweag
  internally and in the context of client projects, being a hive supporter,
  delivery manager, and a blog editor.
* January 14, 2019–2023. Senior software engineer at
  [Tweag](https://tweag.io), Paris, France.
* January 25, 2018–January 11, 2019. Software engineer at Tweag (remote).
* May 4, 2016–May 20, 2017. Tier 2 Haskell developer at [Stack
  Builders](https://www.stackbuilders.com/) (remote).

## Open source

I have been active in open source for the last 8 years or so. Here are top 3
projects that highlight my work:

* [Ormolu](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu)—A formatter for Haskell source
  code.
* [Megaparsec](https://github.com/mrkkrp/megaparsec)—Industrial-strength
  monadic parser combinator library.
* [Req](https://github.com/mrkkrp/req)—An HTTP client library.

The full list can be found at <https://markkarpov.com/oss.html>.

## Writing

* I have authored a number of tutorials as part of my job and on my own, see
  <https://markkarpov.com/learn-haskell.html>.
* Blog posts are available at <https://markkarpov.com/posts.html>, see e.g.
  [“How to keep a Bazel project
  hermetic”](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-09-15-hermetic-bazel/).

## Technologies

* Build systems: correctness, reproducibility, and scalability (I did a
  number of client projects, notably related to Bazel in the context of
  large industrial users).
* Nix is one of the main technologies we use at Tweag. I run NixOS as my
  primary OS and use Nix daily in my work and for personal projects.
* Haskell.
* Strong knowledge of Git.
* DevOps experience (knowledge of some technologies in this area may be
  rusty).
* AWS and GCP.
* Docker.
* CI: GitHub actions, Travis CI, Circle CI, Buildkite.
* Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL.
* Linux server.
* Other languages I know: OCaml, C, C++, Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp, Python.

## Soft skills

* The experience of leading teams and supporting fellow employees.
* The ability to work with people with diverse personalities and skill
  levels.
* Good communicator; many years of experience as a consultant in a diverse
  range of companies.
* I speak Russian (native), English (fluent), and French (intermediate).

## Education

* 2009–2014—Polzunov Altai State Technical University. Engineer degree in
  informational technology and measuring engineering.
