Hey there! I'm a software engineer based in Paris, France. I work at
[Tweag][tweag].

I come from a little town called [Biysk][biysk] in Russia. I learned about
functional programming on my own circa 2015. Soon, my enthusiasm paid offâ€”I
was able to start my career as a software engineer in 2016. Along the way, I
authored some [open source projects][oss], [blog posts][posts], and
[tutorials][tutorials]. In the beginning of 2018 I joined Tweag, and soon
moved to France.

I enjoy traveling and I am an avid reader. My hobbies include writing
(mostly literary short stories in English), music,
[photography](/galleries.html), and watercolor painting. I'm working on
adding some of my creative output to this site, stay tuned!
