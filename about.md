![Mark Karpov](/static/img/my-photo.png 'my_photo')

Hey there! My name is Mark Karpov, I'm a professional Haskell developer.
When I'm not coding or writing about Haskell, I like listening to music,
travelling, and reading.

I've authored and maintain a number of [open source projects](/oss.html),
have written several Haskell-related [tutorials](/learn-haskell.html) (as
part of my paid job and on my own). I've also contributed a few chapters for
an upcoming Haskell book called [Intermediate
Haskell](https://intermediatehaskell.com). On this site I have collected
some stuff I do for easy access, I hope you'll find something that interests
you.
