In this post I'm going to focus on my watercolor palette. I will describe
the choice of colors first and then I will explain the principle by which my
setup has been evolving.

## The colors

I currently use a 12-color palette:

Name                           | L/f | Staining | Granulation | Transparency  | Pigment
-------------------------------|-----|----------|-------------|---------------|--------
<c:f8ec23> Hansa yellow medium | I   | 2        | No          | <fa:adjust>   | PY 97
<c:ffd207> Hansa yellow deep   | I   | 2        | No          | <fa:adjust>   | PY 65
<c:d7861f> Raw sienna          | I   | 2        | Yes         | <fa:adjust>   | PBr 7
<c:e62c24> Pyrrol scarlet      | I   | 3        | No          | <fa:adjust>   | PR 255
<c:5d2c26> Indian red          | I   | 3        | Yes         | <fa:circle>   | PR 101
<c:ae6126> Burnt sienna        | I   | 1        | Yes         | <fa:adjust>   | PBr 7
<c:74461a> Burnt umber         | I   | 2        | Yes         | <fa:adjust>   | PBr 7
<c:5897c2> Cerulean blue       | I   | 1        | Yes         | <fa:adjust>   | PB 35
<c:3466cf> Cobalt blue         | I   | 2        | Yes         | <fa:adjust>   | PB 28
<c:0623ab> Ultramarine blue    | I   | 3        | Yes         | <fa:circle-o> | PB 29
<c:0078b8> Phthalo blue (GS)   | I   | 4        | No          | <fa:circle-o> | PB 15:3
<c:352c2a> Neutral tint        | I   | 2        | No          | <fa:adjust>   | PBk 6, PV 19, PB 15

All colors are [Daniel Smith extra fine][daniel-smith-extra-fine]
watercolors. You can find more information about the lightfastness rating
(**L/f** in the table above) by following the link.

I use a limited palette for the following reasons:

* It is easier to achieve color harmony.
* It is rather hard to master even a 12-color palette. By “master” I mean
  having a clear idea how every pair of colors mixes. I don't want to hunt
  for colors, I need to know precise shades that I can obtain. I also don't
  want to stick with a few colors that I already know well and neglect
  others. For me, 12 colors produce an abundant range of possibilities.

![My current palette Daniel Smith](/static/img/watercolor-palette/daniel-smith.jpg)

This color chart shows on the left hand side the 12 colors of my palette in
their pure form. We can also see how a given color mixes with others. For
example, the color at the left bottom is **neutral tint** and the bottom row
shows its combinations with the remaining 11 colors. Furthermore, the
topmost color on the left hand side is **hansa yellow medium** and the
second column from the left shows how it mixes with the remaining 11 colors.
The leftmost 4th color from the top is **pyrrol scarlet**, in its row we can
see how it combines with 3 different colors, the rest being in the 5th
column from the left, and so on.

Perhaps the most obvious thing about this particular palette is that it does
not allow us to mix arbitrary colors. Indeed, it is not possible to mix an
“acid” green because there is no cool yellow; pure purple is also out of
reach. This is because I consider my palette an essential tool in defining
my style. The colors that I often want to use should be easily to obtain,
and I don't care about colors that I never use. It is even better that I
simply cannot mix them. Color is very personal, and so is the palette.

![My rendition of Edward Wesson's Martham Church, Norfolk](/static/img/watercolor-palette/martham-church.jpg)

The palette has a strong bias towards warm colors. There is no cool yellow,
only a medium yellow and a warm yellow. Of these, I almost never use **hansa
yellow medium** as it seems to be still too acid and lacking subtlety and
mystery. I would like to explore it more, though. I tend to use **hansa
yellow deep** as a mixer for greens which results in dirty olive greens and,
combined with **neutral tint**, dirty yellowish colors for painting autumn
scenes. If I need a light color, I usually reach for **raw sienna** which is
one of my most used colors—indispensable for softening intense colors,
painting nature, and skin tones. **Pyrrol scarlet** is fairly warm and will
not mix pure purple, instead it mixes dirty purples that I find rather
mysterious and perfect for shadows and dirt. I feel very strongly about what
kind of red I want to use. **Pyrrol scarlet** is perfect because it matches
the idea of the quintessential red that I have in my head. I have also tried
a medium red—**pyrrol red** and I simply could not stand it in pure form. I
added **indian red** to have a darker version of red that is different from
two other darker red colors—**burnt sienna** and **burnt umber**. These 3
colors are my “dark red triad” and I use them a lot. **Indian red** in
particular I use more and more because it is not as obvious as **pyrrol
scarlet**, so it can be mixed in in a lot of situations. I use it for cloudy
heavy skies and shadows. Lately, after studying Edward Wesson, I have
acquired a certain bias towards dirty purple and my vehicle of predilection
for achieving shades of dirty purple is **indian red**.

![My rendition of Edward Wesson's Blythburgh Church](/static/img/watercolor-palette/blythburgh-church.jpg)

**Burnt sienna** is a palette staple. I try to mix grays in various ways,
but **burnt sienna** is the most obvious. It is also great for achieving
even dirtier greens. With **phthalo blue** it is not strong enough to
suppress the blue completely, so it produces a lovely grayish green. **Burnt
umber** also mixes grays and my use of it is very similar to that of **burnt
sienna**. I often use **burnt umber** as a way to add subtle chromatism to
**neutral tint**. On to the blues, I don't use **cerulean blue** often, but
I do want to keep it around. It mixes a lovely greenish gray with **raw
sienna** and one of the weirdest purple shades with **pyrrol scarlet**.
**Cobalt blue** is probably the blue that I use most often. To me it is the
standard blue that I reach for e.g. when I need to mix a gray color or blue
for the sky. **Cobalt blue** mixes very light greens, which I rarely want.
With **hansa yellow deep** it mixes a gray. I also use **ultramarine blue**
fairly often for the same purposes as **cobalt blue**, and I find that it
mixes more interesting greens. Especially with **hansa yellow deep** it
doesn't even mix properly, but forms a strange combination that is highly
granulating and interesting. **Phthalo blue (green shade)** is the blue I
use most for mixing greens. It mixes a convincing simple green with **hansa
yellow medium** and a more interesting olive green with **hansa yellow
deep**. I do not use **phthalo blue** often otherwise, because it is very
strong and tends to overpower other colors. It should be noted that it mixes
a very dark color with **pyrrol scarlet**. Speaking of darks, I know that
**neutral tint** is sometimes frowned upon by watercolor snobs because there
are other ways to make a certain color less intense or to mix a black. True,
but with that approach we would be painting with 3 primary colors. Having a
palette is about mixing efficiency and reproducibility of colors. Nothing
beats having a dark color already available on the palette. It saves so much
hassle. It is a quick and reliable way to decrease color intensity
(saturation) and to make a color darker. It is also straightforward to
foresee the results of adding it. **Neutral tint** also mixes interesting
greens with yellows. I consider myself rather a tonal painter and **neutral
tint** is my single most used color. It is also the only color in my palette
that is made of more than one pigment. I tried **lamp black** and it is also
okay, but I prefer **neutral tint** because it doesn't alter the original
shade so much.

I'm not sure why I tend to prefer these colors and their combinations. One
hypothesis is that it seems that these colors match those found in nature,
but it is just a guess.

## Evolution of the palette

In this section I document how my palette evolved and what made me change
it. I hope that the principles I developed might be of interest to others.

### Andrew Pitt's palette

The palette organization that resonated with me early on is described in
[this video][andrew-pitt-setup] by Andrew Pitt. Since most painters consider
3 primary colors (red, yellow, and blue), and it is universally accepted
that there should be at least two (cool and warm) versions of each, why not
go further and have 4 versions of each primary color? This gives us a 12
color palette. To this Andrew adds 4 colors that he is “trying out”.
However, if you watch his videos you will see that he uses the 4 “auxiliary”
colors just as much as 12 “main” colors, so it is fair to say that his
palette has 16 colors.

Name                          | L/f | Staining | Granulation | Transparency  | Pigment
------------------------------|-----|----------|-------------|---------------|--------
<c:fff116> Cadmium lemon      | I   | Yes      | No          | <fa:circle>   | PY 35

<c:263692> French ultramarine | I   | No       | Yes         | <fa:circle-o> | PB 29
<c:009ada> Winsor blue (GS)   | II  | Yes      | No          | <fa:circle-o> | PB 15
<c:ae1229> Alizarin crimson   | IV  | Yes      | No          | <fa:circle-o> | PR 83

<c:172938> Payne's gray       | II  | Yes      | No          | <fa:adjust>   | PB 15, PBk 6, PV 19

All colors are [Winsor & Newton professional
quality][winsor-and-newton-professional] watercolors.

*A few nitpicks: I don't think Andrew uses **cadmium lemon** much preferring
**aureolin**. I also doubt anyone would call **raw umber** a yellow. I think
Andrew just likes to see certain symmetry in the organization of his palette
and thus he describes it as 4 by 4 by 4 base plus some extras.*

Because [my palette][watercolor-equipment] only had 13 wells for colors, and
because I felt that I should try to use as few colors as possible, I decided
to use only 12 primary colors from Andrew's palette. However, since I was
also trying to do this with Sennelier instead of Winsor & Newton, I could
not really find a replacement for **light red**. After some thinking, I
realized that I didn't need **light red** because it is very close to
**burnt sienna** and mostly has the same function. I don't know what Andrew
thinks about that. Thus, I arrived at this 11 color palette:

Name                              | L/f | Transparency  | Pigment
----------------------------------|-----|---------------|--------
<c:fee50f> Lemon yellow           | II  | <fa:circle-o> | PY 3
<c:fee315> Sennelier Yellow Light | I   | <fa:circle-o> | PY 153
<c:e6a42c> Raw sienna             | I   | <fa:circle-o> | PBr 7
<c:855f32> Raw umber              | I   | <fa:circle-o> | PBr 7
<c:df0b2a> Sennelier red          | ?   | <fa:circle-o> | PR 254
<c:bb4d28> Burnt sienna           | I   | <fa:circle-o> | PBr 7
<c:643726> Burnt umber            | I   | <fa:circle-o> | PBr 7
<c:56b4e4> Cerulean blue          | I   | <fa:circle>   | PB 28
<c:126aab> Cobalt blue            | I   | <fa:circle-o> | PB 28
<c:0a4394> Ultramarine deep       | I   | <fa:circle-o> | PB 29
<c:03649e> Phthalo blue           | II  | <fa:circle-o> | PB 15:3

All colors are [Sennelier professional quality][sennelier-watercolors]
watercolors. I could not find any information on staining and granulation
for them. I tried to choose only single pigment paints, but I am not sure
this is as important as some people think.

Here is the color chart I made back then:

![My old Sennelier palette](/static/img/watercolor-palette/sennelier.jpg)

### Neutral tint

Almost immediately I realized that I had trouble achieving high contrast and
very dark darks. If you compare the color chart of my old Sennelier palette
with the one of my current Daniel Smith palette, you probably will notice
that Sennelier is less intense. I took photos of these charts in identical
conditions, so this should give you an idea of how bleak my paintings made
with Sennelier were[1](footnote:1).

![Magical tree](/static/img/watercolor-palette/magical-tree.jpg)

I sought to paint with darker colors. Around that time I discovered Daniel
Smith and bought their **neutral tint**. It was a game changer. I have been
using it regularly ever since. I thought several times of getting rid of it
but always decided against that. The reason to get rid of **neutral tint**
is that unless you pay special attention you end up using the same black
everywhere, which is less interesting than mixing your own blacks that
always vary. However, I have solved that problem by always mixing a bit of
other colors into my **neutral tint** so that there is still a lot of
micro-variation of color.

### White

For a while I was inspired by Javid Tabatabaei and had white paint in my
palette. Many people say that white watercolor is a big no-no. I don't think
white is useless. White is a way to achieve light values but with high
concentration of paint. Sometimes it comes in handy, for example when you
need to paint a very dark area and then join it with a very light area but
without the dark paint migrating completely to the more watery light area.
Oftentimes, it is helpful to have fairly thick light paint or to lighten a
mixture without changing its concentration. Finally, white can be a way to
have a light mixture with higher opaqueness.

![Giverny flowers](/static/img/watercolor-palette/giverny-flowers.jpg)

I have since stopped using white on a regular basis, but I think it is a
valid addition to a palette.

### The switch to Daniel Smith

After a few months of using Sennelier I succumbed to the idea of switching
to Daniel Smith completely. As much as I wanted to support a French company,
I found that Sennelier watercolors were simply not my kind of paints. It was
also a good occasion to reconsider my choices as I gained more experience
and more understanding of what I wanted:

* I realized that I never ever use **lemon yellow** preferring **Sennelier
  yellow light**. The rule said that I needed one warm and one cool yellow,
  but I had no use for a cool yellow, not as a pure color and not as a
  mixer. So I got rid of it.
* With my old Sennelier palette I always had to add something (most often
  **burnt sienna**) to my greens to make them less acid and obvious. I
  wanted to be able to mix nice usable greens from just 2 components. To
  manage that I decided that I needed an even warmer yellow, this is how I
  ended up including **hansa yellow deep**.
* I added **quinicridone gold** as my 4th yellow still trying to follow the
  4 by 4 by 4 principle.
* For the red I knew I wanted something warmer. When I finally tried
  **Pyrrol scarlet** it was an obvious choice. I did not like any other reds
  and the colors they mixed.
* **Indian red** is also a new addition. The principle was that I wanted 4
  reds in my palette, and **indian red** had the shade that no other red in
  my palette had.
* I removed **raw umber** because I found that I didn't use it often and a
  similar shade can be achieved by “cooling” down **burnt umber** with a
  blue.

All other colors stayed the same. I just found their analogues in the range
provided by Daniel Smith. I have to say, Daniel Smith is more intense and
much more granulating paints than Sennelier. I have never looked back.

### Exclusion of quinaridone gold

My palette has 13 paint wells and so for a while I used a 13-color palette.
However, I realized that I used both **hansa yellow deep** and
**quinacridone gold** for the same function—mixing nice olive greens and
dirty yellows. Once I started favoring **quinacridone gold** I would abandon
**hansa yellow deep** completely and vice versa. To me, this was a sign that
I had to choose between the two. The function of every color must be clear
and well-defined. There should be no hesitation during mixing. I chose to
keep **hansa yellow deep** because it is brighter and a single-pigment
paint. It seems to be more versatile than **quinacridone gold**.

![Quinacridone gold removed](/static/img/watercolor-palette/quinacridone-gold-removed.jpg)

### 16 colors?

I will eventually have a palette that will have 16 paint wells. For a while
I thought about the 4 extra colors I could add. I considered adding
something similar to Andrew Pitt's choices: **viridian**, **cobalt violet**,
and some kind of purple (perhaps **quinacridone liliac**). I could also add
back **raw umber**. After giving it some good thought though, I decided that
I will stick to 12 colors as there is really no benefit in adding extra
colors to my current palette. They will only introduce confusion and
possibly destroy the color harmony that my current palette benefits from. If
anything, I would rather remove colors than add more.

## Final thoughts

I think the main principle for building a palette is the same as for
developing your own style—try to notice what you like and what you naturally
tend to do. Adjust to make that kind of stuff easier. This is also a road to
self-discovery.

  1. Well, to be absolutely honest, the paper on which the charts are
     painted plays a huge role in color intensity. The Daniel Smith chart is
     painted on Bockingford, while the Sennelier chart is painted on Arches.
     Arches eats up a lot of color.
