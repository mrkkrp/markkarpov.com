Hey there! I'm a software engineer based in [Château-Thierry][chateau],
France. I work at [Tweag][tweag].

I come from a little town called [Biysk][biysk] in Russia. I learned about
functional programming on my own circa 2015. Soon, my enthusiasm paid off—I
was able to start my career as a software engineer in 2016. Along the way, I
authored some [open source projects][oss], [blog posts][posts], and
[tutorials][tutorials]. In the beginning of 2018 I joined Tweag, and soon
moved to France.

I enjoy traveling and I am an avid reader. My hobbies include
[writing](/writing.html), music, [photography](/galleries.html), and
painting. I'm working on adding some of my creative output to this site,
stay tuned!
