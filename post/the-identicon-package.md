I need to generate identicons for one of my projects so I wrote a package
for this in Haskell. In this blog post I'm gonig to show you how it works
and what it produces.

## The problem

I would like to have a flexible enough package that allows to generate
identicons of greatly varying “texture”. It should be a library that
provides not a rigid function that produces identicons, but some sort of
framework that can be used in many projects with visually different results,
while possibly introducing some characteristic flavor into resulting images.
I want it to be flexible, so I could easy code different aspects/parts of
identicon, swap code of these parts, freely compose graphical primitives. I
want it to be quite fast. I want to make sure that components of identicon
coexist with each other in a clearly defined way and I want to use Haskell's
type system for this (what I really mean by that will be clear soon).

I've written a package that achieves all these goals. It's fairly small
piece of code, but I found it so fun to use so I decided I would share what
it can do in my blog.

## Basics

The basic concept in the package is distribution of bytes between
primitives. Bytes come from a `ByteString` and parametrize code that
generates actual graphics. Every such piece of code that takes bytes and
returns some graphics is called *consumer*. Every consumer produces a
*layer* in the end and it's just an image. All layers are computed
independently and then mixed to produce the final result.

First we should state how many bytes do we have total. This is done at the
type level:

```haskell
type Icon = Identicon 12
```

Here we have zero consumers (and thus zero layers), and 12 bytes. We cannot
use this type with the library because all “available” bytes must be
consumed. To consume the bytes we attach consumers to the identicon with
help of the `:+` type operator:

```haskell
type Icon = Identicon 12 :+ Consumer 4 :+ Consumer 4 :+ Consumer 4
```

Now, this will type check: we've got 12 bytes and consume them all. Every
consumer as I said produces a layer, so we have three different layers here.

Now we need to actually write how to generate every layer, but before we
start playing with graphics, I need to show how do we actually get an image.

Here is how:

```haskell
genIcon
  :: Int               -- ^ Desired width
  -> Int               -- ^ Desired height
  -> ByteString        -- ^ Input (some sort of hash)
  -> Maybe (Image PixelRGB8) -- ^ Resulting image
genIcon = renderIdenticon (Proxy :: Proxy Icon) i
  where
    i :: Implementation Icon
    i = undefined -- TODO
```

`renderIdenticon` is provided by the library and it's the most important
function that actually produces images. It's a good idea to wrap it like
this to get a very straightforward image factory. As you can see we're using
the wonderful
[`JuicyPixels`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/JuicyPixels) package to
work with images. Currently `identicon` only produces `PixelRGB8` pixels for
speed.

If `ByteString` is too short we get `Nothing`. Fair enough, and since hashes
typically have fixed size, it should not be a problem. Also, width and
height must be greater than 0 or again you will get `Nothing`.

Remaining part of the blog post is about writing the `Implementation Icon`
thing.

## Writing layers

`Implementation Icon` is always a bunch of functions that are kept together
with help of the `(:+)` data constructor (this one works on term level).
Every function gets its bytes as discrete `Word8` arguments and produces a
`Layer`.

In practice it means that `i` has the following type:

```haskell
Implementation Icon ≡

Word8 -> Word8 -> Word8 -> Word8 -> Layer :+
Word8 -> Word8 -> Word8 -> Word8 -> Layer :+
Word8 -> Word8 -> Word8 -> Word8 -> Layer
```

Cool, but how do we make a `Layer`?

### What is a `layer` anyway?

`Layer` is an image in the form of a function. If you're familiar with Repa,
it's something like “delayed array”. `Layer` is just a newtype wrapper:

```haskell
newtype Layer = Layer
  { unLayer :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int -> PixelRGB8 }
```

The function takes:

* width
* height
* X coordinate
* Y coordinate

…and returns a `PixelRGB8`. Note how abstract a layer actually is. It's like
vector graphics, it doesn't care about width and height, you can render it
in any size. This means that once you have a `Layer`, you can write
combinators that transform it in various ways and the whole thing is very
composable as we will see shortly.

### Filling with solid color

OK, we can transform existing `Layer`s, but how do we get one to start with?
Simplest layer would be just an area filled with one solid color. He have it
under `color` name:

```haskell
color :: PixelRGB8 -> Layer
color a = Layer $ \_ _ _ _ -> a
```

We also have `black` color:

```haskell
black :: PixelRGB8
black = PixelRGB8 0 0 0
```

When we mix layers we just sum pixel components (with saturation,
naturally). So black color means rather absense of anything. We'll use it in
this role exclusively.

Let's use `color` to put together first working version of `i`:

```haskell
…
  where
    i = Identicon :+ a :+ a :+ a
    a r g b _ = color (PixelRGB8 r g b)
```

Example output:

![Our first identicon](/static/img/identicon-00.png)

Three colors are mixed. For different inputs we get different colors.
Already an identicon of a sort but well… can we make something more
interesting?

### Filling with gradients

Apart from solid color option, there are various gradients:

* `gradientLR`—color transition from left to right

* `gradientTB`—color transition from top to bottom

* `gradientTLBR`—color transition from top left corner to bottom right
  corner

* `gradientTRBL`—the same, but with top right and bottom left corners

* `gradientXY`—one color is on edges and another in the middle

We can try them, let's “mute” all layers but one:

```haskell
…
  where
    i = Identicon :+ a :+ a' :+ a'
    a r g b _ = gradientTLBR id black (PixelRGB8 r g b)
    a' _ _ _ _ = color black
```

![Diagonal gradient](/static/img/identicon-01.png)

Attentive reader will notice the `id` argument. This is a function that can
control color transition. It gets an argument that varies from 0 to 1 and it
should return something in the same range. When it returns 0, we get pure
first color and the second color for 1.

A couple of helpers are available out-of-the-box:

```haskell
mid :: Float -> Float
mid x = 2 * (if x >= 0.5 then 1.0 - x else x)

edge :: Float -> Float
edge x = x * x
```

Replacing `id` with `edge . mid`:

Ready for something more interesting?

```haskell
…
  where
    i = Identicon :+ a0 :+ a1 :+ a2
    a0 r g b _ = gradientTLBR edge black (PixelRGB8 r g b)
    a1 r g b _ = gradientTRBL edge (PixelRGB8 r g b) black
    a2 r g b _ = gradientXY (edge . mid) black (PixelRGB8 r g b)
```

### Shape, size, and position

OK, I can hear you are saying “in *real* identicons you have figures, not
just some strange gradients occupying entire canvas”. Yes, that's right. But
if we have a layer with some color in it, it's easy to have combinators that
would re-size it and put in some specific place on canvas. We can even
replace some part of existing layer with `black` and let the rest be
visible. That's how `circle :: Layer -> Layer` combinator works:

```haskell
…
  where
    i = Identicon :+ a0 :+ a1 :+ a2
    a0 r g b _ = circle $ gradientTLBR edge black (PixelRGB8 r g b)
    a1 r g b _ = gradientTRBL edge (PixelRGB8 r g b) black
    a2 r g b _ = gradientXY (edge . mid) black (PixelRGB8 r g b)
```

![The circle combinator in action](/static/img/identicon-04.png)

Position is controlled by the `onGrid` combinator:

```haskell
onGrid :: Integral a
  => Int               -- ^ Number of horizontal positions
  -> Int               -- ^ Number of vertical positions
  -> a                 -- ^ Index of this cell
  -> Layer             -- ^ Layer to insert
  -> Layer             -- ^ Resulting layer
```

Let's spacially separate our layers:

```haskell
…
  where
    i = Identicon :+ a0 :+ a1 :+ a2
    a0 r g b n = onGrid 3 3 n $ circle $ gradientTLBR mid black (PixelRGB8 r g b)
    a1 r g b n = onGrid 8 1 n $ gradientTRBL mid (PixelRGB8 r g b) black
    a2 r g b _ = gradientXY (edge . mid) black (PixelRGB8 r g b)
```

![Three figures](/static/img/identicon-05.png)

Black background doesn't look good, let's add a background with two-color
gradient:

```haskell
type Icon = Identicon 18 :+ Consumer 4 :+ Consumer 4 :+ Consumer 4 :+ Consumer 6

…
  where
    i = Identicon :+ a0 :+ a1 :+ a2 :+ a3
    a0 r g b n = onGrid 3 3 n $ circle $ gradientTLBR mid black (PixelRGB8 r g b)
    a1 r g b n = onGrid 8 1 n $ gradientTRBL mid (PixelRGB8 r g b) black
    a2 r g b _ = gradientXY (edge . mid) black (PixelRGB8 r g b)
    a3 r0 g0 b0 r1 g1 b1 =
      gradientTLBR id (PixelRGB8 r0 g0 b0) (PixelRGB8 r1 g1 b1)
```

Much better but still sort of boring.

### Symmetry

What identicons on Stack Overflow have that our identicon doesn't? Right,
symmetry. If you look carefully, identicons on Stack Overflow are always a
motif repeated 4 times and every repetition is rotated by 90°. We have
several combinators (all of them have `Layer -> Layer` type) including the
one that can simulate Stack Overflow approach:

* `hsym`—horizontal symmetry

* `vsym`—vertical symmetry

* `hvsym`—horizontal and vertical symmetry

* `rsym`—just like `hvsym` but with “rotation”

Let's use it:

```haskell
…
  where
    i = Identicon :+ a0 :+ a1 :+ a2 :+ a3
    a0 r g b n = rsym $ onGrid 3 3 n $
      circle $ gradientTLBR mid black (PixelRGB8 r g b)
    a1 r g b n = rsym $
      onGrid 8 1 n $ gradientTRBL mid (PixelRGB8 r g b) black
    a2 r g b _ = gradientXY (edge . mid) black (PixelRGB8 r g b)
    a3 r0 g0 b0 r1 g1 b1 =
      hvsym $ gradientTLBR id (PixelRGB8 r0 g0 b0) (PixelRGB8 r1 g1 b1)
```

![With rotation, one](/static/img/identicon-07.png)
![With rotation, two](/static/img/identicon-08.png)
![With rotation, three](/static/img/identicon-09.png)

But hey, we have saved one byte (last argument of `a2`)! We can feed it into
`oneof` combinator to make things a bit more varying.

```haskell
…
  where
    i = Identicon :+ a0 :+ a1 :+ a2 :+ a3
    a0 r g b n = rsym $ onGrid 3 3 n $
      circle $ gradientTLBR mid black (PixelRGB8 r g b)
    a1 r g b n = rsym $
      onGrid 8 1 n $ gradientTRBL mid (PixelRGB8 r g b) black
    a2 r g b n = oneof [ gradientXY (edge . mid)
                       , gradientLR mid
                       , gradientTB mid
                       ] n black (PixelRGB8 r g b)
    a3 r0 g0 b0 r1 g1 b1 =
      hvsym $ gradientTLBR id (PixelRGB8 r0 g0 b0) (PixelRGB8 r1 g1 b1)

```

## Conclusion

Of course this is just a preview and the icons shown here are not the most
interesting ones you can get. As always, everything is limited only by your
imagination. Given such general definition of `Layer`, you can do whatever
you want, even insert some existing pictures into identicons and manipulate
them. I find performance quite satisfactory too.

Hope it was interesting and beautiful!
