One of the advantages of Megaparsec is the ability to use your own data
types as part of data that is returned on parse failure. This opens the
possibility to tailor error messages to your domain of interest in a way
that is quite unique to this library. Needless to say, all data that
constitutes a error message is typed, so it's easy to inspect and manipulate
it.

## The goal

In this tutorial we will walk through creation of a parser found in an
existing library called
[`cassava-megaparsec`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cassava-megaparsec),
which is an alternative parser for the popular
[`cassava`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cassava) library for parsing
CSV data. The default parser features not very user-friendly error messages,
so I was asked to design a better one using Megaparsec.

In addition to the standard error messages (“expected” and “unexpected”
tokens), the library can report problems that have to do with using methods
from the `FromRecord` and `FromNamedRecord` type classes that describe how
to transform a collection of `ByteString`s into a particular instance of
those type classes. While performing the conversion, things can go wrong,
and we would like to use a special data constructor in these cases.

The complete source code can be found in
[this GitHub repository](https://github.com/stackbuilders/cassava-megaparsec).

## Language extensions and imports

We will need some language extensions and imports, here is the top of
`Data.Csv.Parser.Megaparsec` almost literally:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns       #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-}
{-# LANGUAGE RecordWildCards    #-}

module Data.Csv.Parser.Megaparsec
  ( Cec (..)
  , decode
  , decodeWith
  , decodeByName
  , decodeByNameWith )
where

import Control.Monad
import Data.ByteString (ByteString)
import Data.Csv hiding
  ( Parser
  , record
  , namedRecord
  , header
  , toNamedRecord
  , decode
  , decodeWith
  , decodeByName
  , decodeByNameWith )
import Data.Data
import Data.Vector (Vector)
import Data.Word (Word8)
import Text.Megaparsec
import Text.Megaparsec.Byte
import qualified Data.ByteString      as B
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as BL
import qualified Data.Csv             as C
import qualified Data.HashMap.Strict  as H
import qualified Data.Set             as S
import qualified Data.Vector          as V
```

Note that there are two imports for `Data.Csv`, one for some common things
like names of type classes that I want to keep unprefixed and the second one
for the rest (qualified as `C`).

## What is `ParseError` actually?

To start with custom error messages we should take a look at how parse
errors are represented in Megaparsec 7.

At the top level we have `ParseErrorBundle` which is just a way to pass
around a non-empty collection of `ParseError`s together with some state that
is necessary to pretty-print them (it's of no interest to us here).

```haskell
-- | A non-empty collection of 'ParseError's equipped with 'PosState' that
-- allows to pretty-print the errors efficiently and correctly.

data ParseErrorBundle s e = ParseErrorBundle
  { bundleErrors :: NonEmpty (ParseError s e)
    -- ^ A collection of 'ParseError's that is sorted by parse error offsets
  , bundlePosState :: PosState s
    -- ^ State that is used for line\/column calculation
  }
```

The main type for error messages is `ParseError` which is defined like this:

```haskell
-- | @'ParseError' s e@ represents a parse error parametrized over the
-- stream type @s@ and the custom data @e@.
--
-- 'Semigroup' and 'Monoid' instances of the data type allow to merge parse
-- errors from different branches of parsing. When merging two
-- 'ParseError's, the longest match is preferred; if positions are the same,
-- custom data sets and collections of message items are combined. Note that
-- fancy errors take precedence over trivial errors in merging.

data ParseError s e
  = TrivialError Int (Maybe (ErrorItem (Token s))) (Set (ErrorItem (Token s)))
    -- ^ Trivial errors, generated by Megaparsec's machinery. The data
    -- constructor includes the offset of error, unexpected token (if any),
    -- and expected tokens.
  | FancyError Int (Set (ErrorFancy e))
    -- ^ Fancy, custom errors.
  deriving (Typeable, Generic)
```

We can see immediately that there are two different possibilities for parse
errors:

* `TrivialError`, which is usually generated by Megaparsec's machinery. Most
  parse errors are of this kind.

* `FancyError`, which is a collection of `ErrorFancy` items.

```haskell
-- | Additional error data, extendable by user. When no custom data is
-- necessary, the type is typically indexed by 'Void' to “cancel” the
-- 'ErrorCustom' constructor.
--
-- @since 6.0.0

data ErrorFancy e
  = ErrorFail String
    -- ^ 'fail' has been used in parser monad
  | ErrorIndentation Ordering Pos Pos
    -- ^ Incorrect indentation error: desired ordering between reference
    -- level and actual level, reference indentation level, actual
    -- indentation level
  | ErrorCustom e
    -- ^ Custom error data, can be conveniently disabled by indexing
    -- 'ErrorFancy' by 'Void'
  deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord, Data, Typeable, Generic, Functor)
```

`ErrorFail` and `ErrorIndentation` are required by the library. The
constructor `ErrorCustom` works like an extension slot allowing to insert
arbitrary data inside. When we don't need any custom data, we can “multiply
the constructor by zero” by parametrizing `ErrorFancy` by `Void`. Since
`Void` is not inhabited by any value other than bottom, the `ErrorCustom`
constructor cannot be used.

## Defining a custom error component

The custom error component will store conversion errors when a vector of
`ByteString`s cannot be converted into some type:

```haskell
-- | Custom error component for CSV parsing. It allows typed reporting of
-- conversion errors.

data ConversionError = ConversionError String
  deriving (Eq, Data, Typeable, Ord, Read, Show)

instance ShowErrorComponent ConversionError where
  showErrorComponent (ConversionError msg) =
    "conversion error: " ++ msg
```

`ConversionError` is just a wrapper around a `String` that conversion
functions of Cassava return. We could do better if Cassava provided typed
error values, but `String` is all we have, so let's work with it.

The `ShowErrorComponent` instance defines how to render the custom error
component.

Another handy definition we need is the `Parser` type synonym:

```haskell
-- | Parser type that uses custom error component 'ConversionError'.

type Parser = Parsec ConversionError BL.ByteString
```

Since it's recommended to work with concrete types in your parser to get
maximum efficiency out of the library, we'll be writing parsers of this
`Parser` type.

## Top level API and helpers

Let's start from the top and take a look at the top-level, public API:

```haskell
-- | Deserialize CSV records form a lazy 'BL.ByteString'. If this fails due
-- to incomplete or invalid input, 'Left' is returned. Equivalent to
-- 'decodeWith' 'defaultDecodeOptions'.

decode :: FromRecord a
  => HasHeader
     -- ^ Whether the data contains header that should be skipped
  -> FilePath
     -- ^ File name (only for displaying in parse error messages, use empty
     -- string if you have none)
  -> BL.ByteString
     -- ^ CSV data
  -> Either (ParseErrorBundle BL.ByteString ConversionError) (Vector a)
decode = decodeWith defaultDecodeOptions

-- | Like 'decode', but lets you customize how the CSV data is parsed.

decodeWith :: FromRecord a
  => DecodeOptions
     -- ^ Decoding options
  -> HasHeader
     -- ^ Whether the data contains header that should be skipped
  -> FilePath
     -- ^ File name (only for displaying in parse error messages, use empty
     -- string if you have none)
  -> BL.ByteString
     -- ^ CSV data
  -> Either (ParseErrorBundle BL.ByteString ConversionError) (Vector a)
decodeWith = decodeWithC csv

-- | Deserialize CSV records from a lazy 'BL.ByteString'. If this fails due
-- to incomplete or invalid input, 'Left' is returned. The data is assumed
-- to be preceded by a header. Equivalent to 'decodeByNameWith'
-- 'defaultDecodeOptions'.

decodeByName :: FromNamedRecord a
  => FilePath
     -- ^ File name (only for displaying in parse error messages, use empty
     -- string if you have none)
  -> BL.ByteString
     -- ^ CSV data
  -> Either (ParseErrorBundle BL.ByteString ConversionError) (Header, Vector a)
decodeByName = decodeByNameWith defaultDecodeOptions

-- | Like 'decodeByName', but lets you customize how the CSV data is parsed.

decodeByNameWith :: FromNamedRecord a
  => DecodeOptions
     -- ^ Decoding options
  -> FilePath
     -- ^ File name (only for displaying in parse error messages, use empty
     -- string if you have none)
  -> BL.ByteString
     -- ^ CSV data
  -> Either (ParseErrorBundle BL.ByteString ConversionError) (Header, Vector a)
decodeByNameWith opts = parse (csvWithHeader opts)

-- | Decode CSV data using the provided parser, skipping a leading header if
-- necessary.

decodeWithC
  :: (DecodeOptions -> Parser a)
     -- ^ Parsing function parametrized by 'DecodeOptions'
  -> DecodeOptions
     -- ^ Decoding options
  -> HasHeader
     -- ^ Whether to expect a header in the input
  -> FilePath
     -- ^ File name (only for displaying in parse error messages, use empty
     -- string if you have none)
  -> BL.ByteString
     -- ^ CSV data
  -> Either (ParseErrorBundle BL.ByteString ConversionError) a
decodeWithC p opts@DecodeOptions {..} hasHeader = parse parser
  where
    parser = case hasHeader of
      HasHeader -> header decDelimiter *> p opts
      NoHeader  -> p opts
```

Really nothing interesting here, just a bunch of wrappers that boil down to
running the `parser` either with skipping the CSV header or not.

## The parser

Let's start with parsing a field. A field in a CSV file can be either
escaped or unescaped:

```haskell
-- | Parse a field. The field may be in either the escaped or non-escaped
-- format. The returned value is unescaped.

field :: Word8 -> Parser Field
field del = label "field" (escapedField <|> unescapedField del)
```

An escaped field is written inside straight quotes `""` and can contain any
characters at all, but the quote sign itself `"` must be escaped by
repeating it twice:

```haskell
-- | Parse an escaped field.

escapedField :: Parser ByteString
escapedField =
  B.pack <$!> between (char 34) (char 34) (many $ normalChar <|> escapedDq)
  where
    normalChar = anySingleBut 34 <?> "unescaped character"
    escapedDq  = label "escaped double-quote" (34 <$ string "\"\"")
```

Simple so far. `unescapedField` is even simpler, it can contain any
character except for the quote sign `"`, delimiter sign, and newline
characters:

```haskell
-- | Parse an unescaped field.

unescapedField :: Word8 -> Parser ByteString
unescapedField del = BL.toStrict <$> takeWhileP (Just "unescaped character") f
  where
    f x = x /= del && x /= 34 && x /= 10 && x /= 13
```

To parse a record we have to parse a non-empty collection of fields
separated by delimiter characters (provided by `DecodeOptions`). Then we
convert it to `Vector ByteString`, because that's what Cassava's conversion
functions expect:

```haskell
-- | Parse a record, not including the terminating line separator. The
-- terminating line separate is not included as the last record in a CSV
-- file is allowed to not have a terminating line separator.

record
  :: Word8             -- ^ Field delimiter
  -> (Record -> C.Parser a)
     -- ^ How to “parse” record to get the data of interest
  -> Parser a
record del f = do
  notFollowedBy eof -- to prevent reading empty line at the end of file
  r <- V.fromList <$!> (sepBy1 (field del) (void $ char del) <?> "record")
  case C.runParser (f r) of
    Left msg -> customFailure (ConversionError msg)
    Right x  -> return x
```

`(<$!>)` works just like the familiar `(<$>)`operator, but applies
`V.fromList` strictly. Now that we have a vector of `ByteString`s, we can
try to convert it: on success we just return the result, on failure we fail
using the `customFailure` helper.

`customFailure` is defined in terms of a more general primitive called
`fancyFaliure`:

```haskell
customFailure :: MonadParsec e s m => e -> m a
customFailure = fancyFailure . E.singleton . ErrorCustom

-- where

fancyFailure
  :: MonadParsec e s m
  => Set (ErrorFancy e) -- ^ Fancy error components
  -> m a

-- and yes, there is also

failure
  :: MonadParsec e s m
  => Maybe (ErrorItem (Token s)) -- ^ Unexpected item (if any)
  -> Set (ErrorItem (Token s)) -- ^ Expected items
  -> m a

-- which you probably won't ever need
```

Back to our task. The library also should handle CSV files with headers:

```haskell
-- | Parse a CSV file that includes a header.

csvWithHeader :: FromNamedRecord a
  => DecodeOptions     -- ^ Decoding options
  -> Parser (Header, Vector a)
     -- ^ The parser that parser collection of named records
csvWithHeader DecodeOptions {..} = do
  !hdr <- header decDelimiter
  let f = parseNamedRecord . toNamedRecord hdr
  xs   <- sepEndBy1 (record decDelimiter f) eol
  eof
  return $ let !v = V.fromList xs in (hdr, v)

-- | Convert a 'Record' to a 'NamedRecord' by attaching column names. The
-- 'Header' and 'Record' must be of the same length.

toNamedRecord :: Header -> Record -> NamedRecord
toNamedRecord hdr v = H.fromList . V.toList $ V.zip hdr v

-- | Parse a header, including the terminating line separator.

header :: Word8 -> Parser Header
header del = V.fromList <$!> p <* eol
  where
    p = sepBy1 (name del) (void $ char del) <?> "file header"

-- | Parse a header name. Header names have the same format as regular
-- 'field's.

name :: Word8 -> Parser Name
name del = field del <?> "name in header"
```

The code should be self-explanatory by now. The only thing that remains is
to parse collection of records:

```haskell
-- | Parse a CSV file that does not include a header.

csv :: FromRecord a
  => DecodeOptions     -- ^ Decoding options
  -> Parser (Vector a) -- ^ The parser that parses collection of records
csv !DecodeOptions {..} = do
  xs <- sepEndBy1 (record decDelimiter parseRecord) eol
  eof
  return $! V.fromList xs
```

## Trying it out

The custom error messages play seamlessly with the rest of the parser. Let's
parse a CSV file as a collection of `(String, Maybe Int, Double)` items. If
I try to parse `"foo`, I get the usual Megaparsec error message with
“unexpected” and “expected” parts:

```
1:5:
  |
1 | "foo
  |     ^
unexpected end of input
expecting '"', escaped double-quote, or unescaped character
```

However, when that phase of parsing is passed successfully, as with
`foo,12,boo` input, the conversion is attempted and its results are
reported:

```
1:11:
  |
1 | foo,12,boo
  |           ^
conversion error: expected Double, got "boo" (Failed reading: takeWhile1)
```

(I wouldn't mind if `(Failed reading: takeWhile1)` part were omitted, but
that's what Cassava's conversion methods are producing.)

## Conclusion

I hope this walk-through has demonstrated that it's quite trivial to add
arbitrary data to Megaparsec error messages. This way it's possible to pump
out some data from a failing parser keeping track of things in a type-safe
way, which is one thing we should always care about when writing Haskell
programs.
